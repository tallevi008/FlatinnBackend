We just spent 5 days in the big apple and we drove in to this Brooklyn location.  The host where incredibly attentive and just wonderful, the apartment spotless, hip & modern and really comfortable. 

Do not be intimidated by the transitioning neighborhood as we encountered that many residents are very friendly and helpful (directions) and this particular street has a real interest in making a real change hence empowering their community.

The subway is a little ways (12 to 15 min.) walk. We would use our vehicle to drive to the subway station (there are two corresponding)  and park nearby to facilitate the to and from.  If you need quick access to the subway at all hours of the day and night this may not be the place for you.

The apt. is an excellent value  for the money (as per  many  manhattan locations offer around  the same nightly  $$ rate but have to share their apt ).

She is respectful of one's privacy but always ready to give support when asked upon. Be it in spoken or written form I always got my answers from her within no times. She also proofed to be very flexible in terms of arrival and departure times which I appreciated a great deal. If you are a fan of jazz music (like I am), make sure to double check ahead of time about her current concert dates so as not to miss your hostess on stage like I did (grumble ;-)).

The room I occupied was the smaller one of two that Isabel rents out. So if her flat is fully rented out there can be a maximum of 4 guests plus your hostess in the flat, which can cause some bathroom jam, especially during the hot and humid summer times, when the need for a cool shower is inherent to everyone's desire. 
My room was as depicted. If you plan on using it for double occupancy, I recommend taking Isa's larger room (unless the two of you are very much in love and want to cuddle up close ;-)). Also, if you need a table for writing, ask for the larger room as well, which comes along with one.
The flat itself is absolutely enchanting and furnished with love and an artistic eye to details. It's location is a dream for touristic explorations with anything within walking distance. 
Therefore, I can easily recommend both Isabel and her flat to anyone wishing to immerge himself into the local customs and get a good doze of what it is like "to live like a true Barcelonian".

It's a 20 minute walk from the beach which is a plus. It's located in a very old building on the top floor, so it is rather stuffy and warm in the apartment. The room overlooks a very narrow street/alley so it's rather dark and it's easy to hear the noise coming from the street and the neighboring apartments. There are a few other rooms in the house that are being rented out, so other people will be staying in the house which makes it a necessity to lock the room when you leave the apartment. 

It's important to note that this place has a very strict check out time. On our last day, we had an evening flight but had to check out in the morning. When we asked if we could check out late, Isa told us to take our stuff to the train station and use the lockers there, but the train station does not have lockers. We ended up renting a locker  at a place called "Barcelona lockers". That, I would say changed all the plans for the last day.

The street itself is very lively, but the noises didn't bother me at all as i could easily block them out with earplugs. The location could not have been more sentral, still it's on "the right side" of the Rambla, where you can find more independent shops, restaurants, cafes and bars compared to the same leveled streets towards Raval. It is an old and very charming building, so if you want an minimalistic experience with cold, stainless steel and elevators this is not the place for you! And perhaps you are not the right person for this place either ;) I had to leave earlier due to illness, and was so sorry i couldn't stay throughout the whole month as planned.

The neighbors are noisy sometimes, so if you are a light sleeper, that could be a problem. But I didn't have any trouble. \r

Everything was fantastic. From the moment we booked Cynthia could not have been more helpful with everything and was always ready and willing to answer all of our queries. Cynthia provided us with an extensive list of recommendations for our stay on Maui and we were not disappointed. The condo is located in a quiet but convenient neighbourhood and close to many amenities. We found the condo extremely spacious and it accommodated our party of 3 adults and two teenaged children with no problem at all. Cynthia's condo is the penthouse and is set right on the beach so we were treated to gorgeous Hawaiian sunsets every night, as well as being able to see turtles and whales from our balcony. The condo is beautifully presented and very well equipped - we could not have asked for anything more for our nine day stay. \r

I have booked a pick-up service from the householder, but there are some problems happened about the plane causing the flight delayed. I have informed the householder at once. When we arrived at the airport, we could not find the driver waiting for us at the arrival with our name. Then, I tried to ask for the help from the householder to meet the driver at the airport. After almost one-hour waiting, we are refused by the driver to meet at the airport and He asked us to find his car at the park. How ridiculous! This service costs 20 euro each person but we cannot even have the right to be picked up. We were so angry and chose to take the taxi. At the same time, I texted the householder that we were tired of waiting for the driver and we were on the way to ur apartment by taxi.

The householder didn't tell me that I should phone another guy to tell him that we were on the way to the apartment until We arrived. What all she talked about were the money of the pick-up service. We spent another 45 minutes to wait for the guy to send the key. Again, when he came, he talked about the money. We asked for the service, but u did not provide it with us. How dare u to ask for the payment? Besides, do u know what? We are totally seven people, so this service should cost 140 euro totally. But two taxis only cost us 70 euro. The driver knows the guy and the householder. I doubt that they are on the business to play trick with me.

Barcelona is a really nice city to travel, but this experience does make a bad impression on me.

They were two sets of keys which was very convenient for a big group. \r

We stayed here for 3 nights with our two children and found it perfect. We were able to walk or take the metro everywhere we wanted to go, but have a quieter place to sleep and relax. There is a park down the street and a supermarket directly across. Xavi met us on arrival and was very nice and helpful throughout our stay. When my husband accidentally left a few things in the apartment, Xavi collected them and met us upon our return to Barcelona a few days later to return them. Thanks, Xavi! It was a great stay in Barcelona and I would definitely recommend the apartment to anyone looking for space and comfort in a close but quieter neighborhood.

The property is older and there was some remodeling noise for a few hours from the neighboring apartment, which we could hear through what seemed to be a shared skylight, but it was very brief and not a concern (unless noise privacy is a very high priority, which it wasn't for us).  We didn't even use the third bedroom with bunk beds, but it would be ideal for a family.  The metro was close enough, and the bakery just downstairs, together with the grocery store literally across the street, were a wonderful convenience.  We went nearly everywhere by metro, and the location was central enough that at the end of the day, if we were too tired to make our way back by metro, an easy cab ride back to the apartment never exceeded 8 euros (which would've been the cost of the metro for all four of us anyway).

She is with much hospitality and send us some local pastry as gift on leaving.`},{at:"2016-04-05T04:00:00.000Z",by:{_id:"622f3405e36c59e6164fb903",fullname:"Molinta",imgUrl:"https://robohash.org/64694281?set=set1",id:"64694281"},txt:"\u9019\u662F\u4E00\u6BB5\u975E\u5E38\u5B8C\u7F8E\u7684\u6C11\u4FD7\u9AD4\u9A57\uFF61Michelle\u975E\u5E38\u7684\u548C\u5584\u771F\u8AA0\uFF61APT\u5728\u5C16\u6C99\u5480\u7684\u4E2D\u5FC3,\u96E2\u6700\u8FD1\u7684\u5730\u9435\u7AD9\u4E0D\u5230\u4E94\u5206\u9418\uFF61\u4EA4\u901A\u975E\u5E38\u7684\u4FBF\u5229,\u6240\u4EE5\u8CFC\u7269\u548C\u904A\u73A9\u90FD\u6709\u5F88\u597D\u7684\u9AD4\u9A57\uFF61Michelle\u975E\u5E38\u71B1\u60C5\u7684\u70BA\u6211\u5011\u4ECB\u7D39\u4E86\u9644\u8FD1\u4E00\u4E9B\u5F88\u597D\u7684\u8CFC\u7269\u9EDE\u548C\u56DE\u7B54\u4E86\u6211\u5011\u4E00\u4E9B\u554F\u984C\uFF61APT\u88E1\u7684\u5BB6\u5177\u9673\u8A2D\u90FD\u5F88\u6709\u5BB6\u7684\u611F\u89BA,\u9019\u662F\u4E00\u500B\u5F88\u9069\u5408\u5169\u500B\u4EBA\u5C45\u4F4F\u7684\u516C\u5BD3\uFF61"},{at:"2016-04-11T04:00:00.000Z",by:{_id:"622f3407e36c59e6164fbda8",fullname:"\u4E39\u7433",imgUrl:"https://robohash.org/66007064?set=set1",id:"66007064"},txt:"\u5E2E\u8001\u7238\u8001\u5988\u8BA2\u7684\u4F4F\u5BBF\uFF61\u4ED6\u4EEC\u7B2C\u4E00\u6B21\u53BB\u9999\u6E2F \u4EC0\u4E48\u90FD\u4E0D\u901A \u8001\u677F\u62C5\u5FC3\u4ED6\u4EEC\u627E\u4E0D\u5230 \u5728\u5730\u94C1\u7AD9\u53BB\u63A5\u5E94 \u5E76\u4E14\u7ED9\u4E86\u5F88\u591A\u5E2E\u52A9\uFF61\u6E38\u73A9\u4E24\u5929\u8981\u79BB\u5F00\u7684\u65F6\u5019\u5F97\u77E5\u4ED6\u4FE9\u672A\u53BB\u592A\u5E73\u5C71 \u53C8\u4E3B\u52A8\u63D0\u51FA\u514D\u8D39\u5E2E\u5FD9\u7BA1\u7406\u884C\u674E \u5EFA\u8BAE\u4ED6\u4EEC\u53BB\u6E38\u73A9 \u665A\u4E0A\u4E24\u4E2A\u4EBA\u5F00\u5FC3\u5730\u56DE\u5230\u4E86\u6DF1\u5733\uFF61\u611F\u8C22Michelle\u7684\u670D\u52A1 \u8BA9\u4ED6\u4EEC\u7684\u884C\u7A0B\u66F4\u52A0\u5B8C\u7F8E\uFF61"},{at:"2016-04-11T04:00:00.000Z",by:{_id:"622f3403e36c59e6164fb1b4",fullname:"Daniel",imgUrl:"https://robohash.org/10915734?set=set1",id:"10915734"},txt:"Cozy and clean.

It was a very pleasant first experience with Airbnb with Michelle&May. Before the trip, we were given immediate and friendly response from host and on the day of our arrival, she came to pick us up at the nearest bus stop, where we took a direct cityflyer bus from the Airport as per our host's guidance.\r
\r
Apt was tidy, clean, cosy and comfortable for our three nights stay. Host even provided snacks/tidbits and several drink mix. There were bedroom slippers, electric kettle, microwave, cups, bowls and utensils, TV, basic toiletries and hairdryer. We were told that the temperature of the aircon could not be adjusted but that did not affect us at all because the temperature was just right throughout our stay during the rainy season period. \r
\r
We were also given a precise mini tour of what was in the apt and how we could use the very convenient sofa bed (which we didn't use in the end because the third person did not stay with us). There's wifi in the apt as well. However, we did experience some connection issues with the TV on one night which we gave up after awhile when we couldn't watch the few channels we wanted to. \r
\r
It's a very quiet building located extremely convenient to the MTR, just 2 minutes walk to the nearest exit (and probably another 5-8 mins walk before you reach the MTR gantry). Right across the building on the ground floor there are two popular cafes and one ice cream shop that I would highly recommend and they need no introduction, just (Hidden by Airbnb) it if you're a fellow cafehopper/dessert person. \r
\r
It is also very near the k11 mall, an art mall that I loved a lot and even managed to check out the Urban Sense art exhibition for free! (Because we snapped a photo of the exhibition board and posted it on our social media accounts but thankfully we went in for free as there were nothing much in there and we were basically out in 15 minutes. But still, do check it out if you happen to be there and follow the instructions to get the free entrance!)\r
\r
At the end of our stay, our host even surprised with a little gift - a box of Jenny Bakery cookies, which we really appreciated a lot :)\r
\r
Overall, it's a nice, cosy little apt for 2-3 pax accommodation in Hong Kong and definitely cheaper but value-for-money alternative compared to hotel stay. It was smaller than I had imagined since I have only stayed in hotel during all my trips to HK located on the Hong Kong island but truth be told, I wouldn't mind heading back to book my stay with Michelle&May, probably check out their other listings which are all also located on Kowloon :)`},{at:"2016-04-28T04:00:00.000Z",by:{_id:"622f3406e36c59e6164fbc83",fullname:"Phan",imgUrl:"https://robohash.org/30073582?set=set1",id:"30073582"},txt:"The location is great. 7eleven and Wellcome are just in front of your flat.

Maui Vision became a reality and a business starting with my personal condo at the Kihei Akahi Resort C618.\r
\r
Maui Vision is a business I love because I get to share the Aloha Spirit, the beauty of the land, and talk story with people from around the world. It is nice to know that we can contribute to someone\u2019s Hawaiian vacation experience in a positive way. We love to hear back from our happy guests.\r
\r
I used to live on the island of Oahu with my US Navy family when I was young.  We later moved to Southern California.  I knew one day I would return to Hawaii, the place I fell in love with long ago. I took a leap of faith and purchased my Maui condo June 2002 this was the beginning of fulfilling her prophecy to once again return to Hawaii soil.\r
\r
I am a tropical expression artist who paints on canvas and etched metal.  My work is inspired by the beauty of the islands and has been displayed in several Maui art galleries over the years.  I am a writer and have my first book on Amazon.  I recently took up hula dancing and love to immerse myself in the culture and grace of this island.\r
\r
I have over 25 years of business administration and customer service experience working for large corporations and high tech startups.\r

There are 4 separate bedrooms each with a desk, closet and drawers.  The apartment is in a great neighborhood with easy access to anything you want to do.  We LOVED the area and I enjoyed running in the nearby park daily.  The neighborhood is very safe and we all felt immediately "at home." I cannot say enough about the customer service provided by Flatbook.  Upon check we had an issue with the lockbox.  Erika was over within 5 minutes to assist us.  She was kind, personable and professional.  We had a small issue with one the beds that had not been properly assembled.  We sent a message and within hours someone came and delivered a new bed. There was a minor issue with front door of the building as it appeared someone had broken a hinge. This didn't really compromise security but I let them know as I thought it would polite.  It was fixed before I saw it again.  I have stayed at hotels with maintenance teams on site that could not provide this level of customer service.  They truly deliver on their promise of 5 star 24 hour service.

Thanks Orestes- we'll definitely come back."},{at:"2011-10-03T04:00:00.000Z",by:{_id:"622f3403e36c59e6164fb226",fullname:"Mandy",imgUrl:"https://robohash.org/1004803?set=set1",id:"1004803"},txt:`What a wonderful holiday and a wonderful place to stay! We were unsure about staying in Queens is opposed to Manhattan, worried that we might feel slightly out of the way, but we had absolutely no need to worry at all - the subway is round the corner (next to the best chinese take-away ever!) and really does take you to the thick of it within ten minutes. There is also a lovely river walk about 15 minutes away which give you the most wonderful views of Manhattan, and there are loungers to relax on at the waters edge!\r
The house is absolutely beautiful (you can tell Orestes is an architect), you have your own front door and the room is plenty big enough (I stayed with a friend - she slept on the double futon which was very comfy). It also has air conditioning. The bathroom is stunning, with a huge steam room/shower, and it is not shared with anyone else. We were given plenty of fresh towels most days. Orestes' office is on the same floor and then the back garden is just lovely - a great place to sit and eat a takeaway or, as we did, sit and have breakfast.\r
As a host Orestes was faultless really! He was very friendly and helpful, and we enjoyed telling him about our day - he was happy to recommend places to see and to eat, but also totally respected our privacy and we felt would have probably left us totally to our own devices if we'd wanted. He also had a lovely little dog called Kiki!\r
There was no weird faff with deposits or cleaning fees, everything was simple and wonderful. I honestly can't wait to go back and I want to take all of my friends. Don't hesitate to stay here.\r

We met Orestes briefly, as he was out of town most of the time, and he is extremely hospitable and helpful.  Chris, who was around the rest of the time, was also kind and available for any questions.\r
The location is convenient to a grocery store, decent diner, and several subway lines; it's pretty simple to get to Queens, Brooklyn, or Manhattan.\r
Future guests should be aware that while the guest room itself might be non-smoking, the rest of the house isn't.  Most of the evenings the cigarette smoke was unavoidable, though not too bad if you kept the door to the guest room shut.  (Being first-trimester-pregnant, my nose and nausea levels felt sensitive to this, but I imagine it wouldn't be an issue for most folks, unless you had asthma or some other sensitivity.)\r
On whole, it was a good home base for our week in New York; everyone was friendly and the accommodations were nice.`},{at:"2012-03-13T04:00:00.000Z",by:{_id:"622f3406e36c59e6164fbad5",fullname:"Mistie",imgUrl:"https://robohash.org/1795764?set=set1",id:"1795764"},txt:"Orestes was a great host!

Orestes house is located in a historically beautiful street and the room is comfortably furnished with a touch of creative people. Nice bathroom with a shower big enough for two and the sunny garden was beautiful.\r
\r
It was nice to meet Orestes and Cristi\xE0ns hospitality, helpfulness and kindness and Kikki, the dog of the house, always greeted us welcome. We felt very welcome and our expectations were fully met. We will certainly return to this place again when we visit New York next time and can only give our warmest recommendations to this place.\r

About the owner:\r
We had a nice conversation over the phone. I felt comfortable with my decision to book his place .Orestes the owner had his friend Gabbi waiting for us when we arrived. She guided us through out our visit and made us feel at  home.  She was kind enough to spend time on the computer, explaining us where to go and how to get there, as well as many important tips that made the difference in our trip. We were lucky to have her.\r

She and her friend provided a delicious and substantive breakfast in the morning.  Nice neighborhood right on St. Denis.  Large sunny room with comfy queen mattress. Fun and funky decor, nice little terrace and ktichen.  Couple of things: 1)  there are two bathrooms- one with toilet, the other with sink and bathtub.  The sink drained realy slowly so was a little discouraging.  Shower was fine, water pressure a little low.  2) our room, the Green Room, is right on St. Denis - trucks ROARing woke us early a.m.  3) be sure to take your room key with you when you go to the bathroom, etc, otherwise your door will lock!  Maybe I'm fussier than my younger reviewers, but these are important to note.  Otherwise, a very nice stay with friendly and knowledgable hosts.\r

The facilities were fantastic and we enjoyed using the pool (which is also a lot bigger in person) which has stunning views over Rio, including Christ the Redeemer on Corcovado mountain. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful and learnt our faces immediately so we had no problem at all gaining access to the very secure apartment (the staff buzz you in the gates via CCTV). The neighbourhood is more downtown Rio and if you like a good night out it will be perfect for you. We didn't feel that the neighbourhood was the safest of areas in Rio, but then again anywhere in Rio during the night isn't the safest place to be. The noise from the street at night was sometimes a little loud especially on Fridays and Saturdays which are extremely busy times in Lapa however we understand that this noise is unavoidable and inevitable. It must also be taken into consideration that we were in Rio for the busiest two weeks of the year, during the 2016 Olympics, a time when at night there were hundreds of thousands of tourists on the streets as well as the locals! Despite this as soon as we entered the double electronic gated apartment block we felt completely at ease and safe and during or time in Rio we spent one of the day's exploring Lapa, admiring its arches and the colourful artwork and graffiti that the locality had to offer. The apartment was perfect for us, size, location, accessibility were all excellent. Our neighbours were very friendly and helpful and would always say "good morning" and "good evening" in the elevator throughout the day. There was a very convenient supermarket just 1 minutes  walk from the apartment and the kitchen had everything you could possible need. If however you prefer to eat out, Lapa has many excellent bars and restaurants and so does Copacabana and Ipanena if you want to travel a little further away. The shower was particularly excellent-hot water was always in abundance. This apartment had everything we wanted and we couldn't have asked for a better place to stay during our time spent in Rio De Janeiro for the Olympics. If and when we ever return to Rio Dejanira's apartment is the only option for us and we would love to stay there again.`},{at:"2016-09-21T04:00:00.000Z",by:{_id:"622f3402e36c59e6164fae52",fullname:"Fl\xE1vio",imgUrl:"https://robohash.org/67209131?set=set1",id:"67209131"},txt:"Excelente!

The stairway is a bit of a chore to negotiate and there is a bar below that caters to enthusiastic sports fans so if the game goes late you can hear their responses to great plays and bad calls.

The kitchen area functions well, there is a good shower, and having a washer and dryer unit is great!

Here are the pros and cons of our experience with this rental: Pros: **Beach access within walking distance **Views **Kitchen well stocked with essentials **Clean and tidy **Beach towels provided (had to get them delivered since none were in the unit as expected, but they came quickly) Cons: **Beds are not comfortable **Pillows could use replacing - they are very flat **All closet doors were next to impossible to open ( this would not have been an issue had there been any sort of dresser with drawers in the master or if the dresser in the second room had drawers that opened, but there wasn't and they didn't, so we had to live out of our suitcases for the week) **We were told there were sand toys, but there weren't. There was snorkel gear and a lone bucket, but no sand toys. A bit of a bummer for the kids who wanted to build sand castles. Things you should know before booking: **this unit is NOT beachfront, it is shorefront. During our stay the water was out far enough at low tide that we could walk on the sand to the nearby beach, but at no point were you able to set up a blanket and play in the sand right in front of the unit. **pictures of the listing are "doctored up" for lack of a better term. All the decor is the same and it's definitely the same unit, but you can tell once you walk in that the images were softened and brightened to add listing appeal. Case in point - I showed my 11 year old the pictures of the listed before we took our trip and upon arrival his first words were "this looks nothing like the photos." **that being said, our boys LOVED waking up in the morning when the tide was out and going exploring in the exposed reefs for fish and sea creatures - this is the most redeeming quality of this unit. We did this most mornings as they never tired of exploring, and one morning we even had a few Humuhumu fish shimming right around us when the water was only up to our knees. Very cool. **owner requires a $500 safety deposit that was not explained in the listing at the time we booked, we received a contract after the fact requesting this deposit and the taxes (also not made clear) so you think you're paying one total price, but you will need to pay more **you are not allowed to run the AC in the unit at night and leaving windows open to utilize cool air crosswinds is not an option as the birds outside the bedroom windows provide you with a 5am wake up call **we were checked out for 10 days with no sign of our security deposit being returned.

You simply cannot beat the location!  Do not believe the other guest review... nothing was doctored up, the furniture was great, we used the AC whenever we wanted to.  There were plenty of sand toys, snorkel gear, etc.  There were no issues.  

My sister and I were on a quest to see as many turtles on Maui as possible and we saw more than 5 everyday right in front of the condo!  They come and feed on the reef between the hours of 10 am and 3 pm.  Much better than having to drag all of your stuff to the beach and then back.  My husband would be sitting outside on the patio enjoying his coffee and cigar, signal that there was a turtle, and we literally threw on our bathing suits, grabbed the snorkel gear and were in the water in a matter of seconds!  

A total of 4 adults stayed at the condo for over a week and it was cozy but very comfortable.  The kitchen had everything that we needed.  We cooked breakfast, cut fruit from the farmers market, made smoothies; every kitchen tool we needed was there for us.  The beds were comfortable, there were curtains that we could shut to let some breeze in but still have privacy.  The newly done wood-like tile floors were a plus also.  

We had looked at many condos in this area and in the Kihei area and we are so glad we chose this one.  Francesco was also so easy to work with, always responded quickly when we had questions.

We had 5 guests staying for 7 days. There are 2 bedrooms, 1 with 2 single beds and 1 with a queen size bed and a pull out couch in the living room. The 2 single beds and the pull out couch were in bad shape. Both of the single beds were completely sloped (over used perhaps) and the pull out bed was completely sunken-in, and very very uncomfortable. Aside from the beds, the location and resort was great. The pool was nice and quiet, there is a great view facing the water by the kitchen and it was decently clean. A few notes for potential guests - we did notice a lot of dust on the bedside tables and some dirty qtips on the floor in one of the bedrooms, but we did a few vacuum and sweeps on our own over the week. Also an FYI - there was also not enough toilet paper for the week, so you'll have to get your own.

The home is equipped with everything needed for beach/fun (snorkels, massive amounts of towels, play equipment, boogie boards, inflatables, even a couple pairs of water shoes) Unfortunately, because of construction and large waves forming sinkholes, there was a very obstructed view of the ocean due to a temporary fence/cones, plus construction workers walking back & forth across the patio area. This meant the patio area was not as private and not as usable due to the fencing.  Francesco was accommodating in partially refunding us and has been very quick to respond to any issues we had.

Note as other reviewers have said, this property is shorefront/oceanfront not beachfront, which means if you stay during a time when there are large waves, you won\u2019t be able to walk out of the patio area and jump in the ocean since there are lots of large rocks lining the shorefront and very little sand/beach space. There\u2019s a beach only 1 block away perfect for kids since it has a natural wading pool with rocks blocking the waves.

We had some issues with the cleanness of the house and ended up buying wet Swiffer ourselves and clean the floor and some other kitchen amenities that wasn't fully clean when we arrived. 

Hot shower was also not working for multiple times, and there are several occasions (at least we know of )that all electricity got shut off (up to 15 min each or so each time), which probably ruined some food in the refrigerator. This might be beyond the owner's control, but something we noticed while we were there.

Overall, we enjoyed our stay in Francesco's place - can't beat the location.`},{at:"2018-09-13T04:00:00.000Z",by:{_id:"622f3403e36c59e6164fb067",fullname:"Sharon",imgUrl:"https://robohash.org/74526260?set=set1",id:"74526260"},txt:"A lovely place to stay, perfectly located within easy walk of shops and restaurants, although we did eat out in Lahaina itself which was lovely.

My grandma wasn't able to snorkel, but she loved sitting on the Lanai watching the waves with beautiful views of the islands across (I think it is both Molokai AND Lanai?). She even got to see a sea turtle right out front! Francesco was very helpful, friendly and quick to respond with anything we needed. Location was unbeatable too!

Daniel was great at communicating and gave us lots of tips before we arrived.

Arriving was very straight forward (although it was surprising when the Doorman asked for our passport!) Daniel very kindly let us check in early - what a star!

The place is spacious (for Hong Kong), though if you're planning on cooking you'll likely have to spread out into the living room. Bed is comfy, shower is hot - what more could you want :)

If you don't mind walking up lots of steps and steep hills, you can easily see many of the main HK Island sights on foot. If walking isn't your thing, there's plenty of public transport options reasonably close.

This place is really slap bang in the middle of things - close to restaurants, bars, cafes, supermarkets, shopping centres.

It's a great place to base yourself, particularly if you're only there for a short trip, like were.

Warning though: the area is very steep! You'll feel it in your calves :)`},{at:"2018-07-30T04:00:00.000Z",by:{_id:"622f3404e36c59e6164fb520",fullname:"Kiran",imgUrl:"https://robohash.org/2714512?set=set1",id:"2714512"},txt:"Great place to stay if you are visiting Hong Kong.

PMQ mall is across the street & visible through the window. Lots of food & drinks nearby, Lan Kwai Fong included (10 min walk). 

Although conveniently located, it is quiet as party-goers are found wandering in the streets starting one block away. For a straight-shot to the Sheng Wan station, take a couple long flights of stairs. If you have luggage & want to avoid that, use the Central station (or Uber) but keep in mind it is always very crowded there. 

Apartment was spacious for Hong Kong standards. Shower pressure was strong & stayed hot through long hair washing. Living room has surround sound system & English channels to watch TV. There's an extra closet room for hanging clothes. 

Overall, great place to stay as compared to other HK apartments. 

Also note, not all amenities at Dan's place are for communal use. This was not listed under House Rules nor noted anywhere. I was surprised to receive a note after check-out that an already open beverage was not for share although fridge was listed as an amenity. Through dozens of stays on Airbnb, this was my first experience encountering such an issue.

We checked in late at night but Melanie gave us all the information before arrival so we could check in easily on our own. If you once find this place, you will relalise how close it is from Soho, but getting here for the first time wasn't very easy for us. I stayed here with my husband and my brother's family and the place was spacious enough (considering its hongkong) for us all to hang around. You need to walk up to the 4th floor but wasn't a problme at all to us. 
We had some issue about electricity but Melanie responded quickly and helped us sort out the problem. One thing we felt inconvenient was hot shower but we got used to it later. And, it was very considerate of Melanie to prepare three heaters for us. 
I highly recommend this place for a family or groups of 4-5 ppl and especially those who wish to enjoy the atmosphere of Soho area and lankwaifong. I and my husband went out for a drink every night and found awesome bars and restaurants. We could have done it easily as the place is so close to it.

The area around the apartment has stores, restaurants, a Mercadona Supermarket, and many smaller grocery stores. The sidewalks are broad and evenly graded which makes for easy walking, and clean.

Public buses are frequent and easy to use, and there is an underground Metro station nearby within easy walking distance.

David was what I would call a super host. His apartment was well equipped with every modern convenience and very clean. It was also very well stocked with food; bread, milk, juice, fresh fruit, butter, coking oil, etc., including a bottle of wine.

He patiently and carefully explained the works of every appliance in the apartment, including the use of the television features, and he made sure you are aware that he is available for any question later on. Communicating in English was not a problem.

We greatly appreciated the considerable time he spent providing us with detailed explanation of all the major attractions of Barcelona and how to get there. His Guest Guidebook includes all the details one could possibly ever need while in Barcelona, from managing emergency situations, using public transport, maps, to restaurants, shops, museums and all major attractions. Our visit to Barcelona was made much easier because of the book, and we learned a lot more.

We would recommend anyone visiting Barcelona to use David's place. We will definitely return to David's apartment if we should want to visit Barcelona again. The five days we were there were not enough.

It is no surprise that the owner has been awarded the Tripadvisor Certificate of Excellence.  

David keeps in touch, checking in to see if/what there is anything we need, in addition to recommending places to visit.  It's not just lip service.  For example, we suggested he consider adding a mat in the bathtub, which could be a bit slippery.  Later that day, DONE.

For example, when it was was time to vacate after our ten-day stay, we asked if would do us the favour of arranging for a mini-van to pick us up at 5:30am, as we were taking a train on to San Sebastian, and couldn't risk any misunderstanding if we tried booking this ourselves.  After checking around, David came back with an answer.  The going rate was too high and he was still looking to find us much more reasonable transportation.  He DID.

The apartment sits in a somewhat old building which is a contrast to the apartment itself. It has been nicely renovated and has the comfort you would want. It's spacious for a stay with two people. Most of the interior is new and functions properly. This is complemented by nice (and some antique) decorative details.
A pleasant surprise was the smell of freshly baked bread every morning in the staircase. The downstairs neighbour is a bakery where you can get good and cheap bread and your morning espresso.

We have had contact with Teresa through AirBNB, she has been helpful and kind. Tim welcomed us with a gastronomic surprise and even a list of suggestions for our stay in Porto. They are a very hospitable and helpful couple!

While I can usually overlook most shortcomings, the list was too many to ignore here. Wide angle pictures & professionally written listing descriptions will impress most - however, here are some takes from my REAL customer experience at the 414 condo:

"We will provide you with a special code to access the condo after you are booked and paid in full."

- After a 13 day stay, we were charged a "half day rate" for a late checkout for 5 hours over our contracted stay. During our last day, we ended up being locked out of the condo. Thankfully the late checkout fee was refunded due to this situation. Not quite the goodbye from our paradise as we hoped for.

"This unit includes a window A/C in the living room should you need it although we find it is rarely needed because the tradewinds keep you comfortable."

- The AC unit is a measly 12" by 32" window unit that had trouble keeping even the living room & kitchen areas cool. If 86 degrees in your bedroom while sleeping is "comfortable", then this might be the place for you.

"This setting is wonderful for romantic sunset strolls. For the more active person this is a great beach to run on as you can do so for miles in peace away from the crowds."  -- "Three miles of quiet sandy beach will entice you to walk, run, or build sand castles."

- Haycraft Park is roughly 500 feet away from the beach directly in front of this condo, and it was filled with people every day. Half the time we were here, there were campers there who stayed all day and over night with big fish lines across the entire beach. There may be other listings with better seclusion. 

"This unit is spacious and bright."

- Spacious? That's a stretch. But bright? You're absolutely spot on. If you enjoy sleeping in the dark, this place might NOT be for you. Waking up at 530am is ideal for the lighting of this condo, ever with the window shades (which many times had trouble coming down since they are on automatic motors). 

A POSITIVE NOTE:
One thing I cannot get over is the real Mahalo spirit of everyone staying and living at the Kana'i A Nalu resort. While my mother in law and 16 month old daughter got locked out on the last day, many guests there offered help, water, and to hang in their condos while we tried to wait patiently to get back in. The resort has an amazing location and even better spirit within its guests.

Tyler sent his friend to open the door for us, the apartment is dilapidated and old. When we stepped into the room, it smells like curry or some weird things. We thought it will disappear if we open the back door(no windows), but it became worse(there might be some restaurants close to the backyard). We report this to Tyler, he didn't reply, so we told his friend and then he was arguing with us and he said that I am complaining for no reason. He even suggested me to buy a refresher in Dollar store! 

We were very upset, not only the bad smell, but also the dirty old quilt. We tried to take a nap, but people live on the second floor were laughing so loud and traffic outside was noisy. So we decided to move to a hotel. I asked Tyler about this, he didn't reply, but he sent another friend to reply us that he will give us full refund, and we can leave the key in the room then move to a hotel. But after we arrived at the hotel, Tyler finally replied us and said he won't refund us! I tried to communicate with him but he just disappeared again!

The house is large enough for a large group, where everyone is comfortably accommodated yet have enough privacy to feel completely disconnected from the group due to the bedrooms being located over three different levels.

There was a lot of planning and logistics in the lead up to our stay and Bailey was always prompt and accommodating with questions. 
It's a great house for a large family, offering us the perfect bedroom configuration for 9 adults and 4 kids as well as plenty of living space so we weren't living on top of each other. 
We loved the beautiful Pittwater views and dining outdoors on the large deck facing the view.
Beach Escape is also pet friendly which meant all our family were welcome. 
It was fantastic having the amenities of Avalon only 5 mins drive away but feeling like we were in a quiet secluded area far away from the hustle & bustle of Sydney. 
There's plenty of pedestal fans but no air con & blinds on west facing windows made for a hot stay on the days that reached almost 40 degrees. But it meant we made the most of the wonderful harbour beach down the stairs. 
Would highly recommend Beach Escape to large groups. `},{at:"2017-02-20T05:00:00.000Z",by:{_id:"622f3404e36c59e6164fb3c2",fullname:"Maria",imgUrl:"https://robohash.org/11057507?set=set1",id:"11057507"},txt:`This house is perfect for a large extended family group.

The house's many levels mean that even crying babies don't disturb others in the house.

Thursday was my actual birthday and this almost had us packing up and heading home - we were minutes away from cancelling the weekend as we had no way of getting in to the house we had booked for 12 guests. We then get inside and everyone starts to arrive and we all shower and use the toilets. By the time we come out the smell of raw sewage is so unbearable that we can't use the balcony for the dinner we had planned or open any windows on a hot day in a house that has no air con (not that air con was ever listed or promised however). The smell only got worse throughout the weekend as we continued to use the bathrooms. 6 out of 12 guests chose to leave on Friday as a result - ruining the weekend we had planned for my birthday. Two of the couples who left had travelled interstate for this. So they had paid for 3 nights and only got to stay 1 in rooms that stunk of sewage. This could have and should have been resolved on Friday or Saturday - but no solution was offered and we were expected to stay in a house that stunk of sewage. On top of this on Friday, as we bring items down from the car into the house we place two cases on a shelf along the kitchen wall and it comes off completely and lands on my foot. After looking at how it was constructed, a 30-50kg shelf was screwed together by 4 small screws and was never constructed to hold any sort of weight, making it a danger to guests. And lastly, the alarm. At 2.30am on the Saturday morning the house alarm (that we had been told did not work) began going off and woke everyone in the house. The four surrounding suburbs encountered a blackout and as a result the alarm went to auxiliary power and then went into alarm (the blackout is obviously not the owners fault) The alarm continued to go off for an hour and there was no information anywhere as to how to make it stop. We were left to figure this out for ourselves. The number we called inside the panel had no idea, the host was not contactable and the lady he put us in touch with suggested "we push a couple of buttons". The house should not have been rented out with the sewage pump the way it was and the host should have information on hand for his alarm system. We know that the host MAY not have known the pump was broken, but we did make him aware as soon as we noticed it within a couple of hours of arriving and no solution was offered for the three day stay.

Not only it is so clean and safe for kids, its convenient location allows us to return for nap and rest when kids are tired between our busy holiday schedules. Wilson is so approachable and very thoughtful in many details.\r
Clean linens, towels, kitchenware, clothes washing powder, indoor storable clothes liner, refills of every consumable daily essential items eg toilet papers, tissues etc.\r
There are some stairs upon entry into lobby/lift of the building but it is a very common feature in Hong Kong. You can open the French-door-type glass doors fully before you enter with big luggages. The building guards/administrators on duty are very friendly too.\r
Surprisingly, it's so quiet and comfortable to sleep, considering its prime location in one of the busiest parts of Hong Kong. Eating, shopping, sightseeing...all within walking distance or so easy for additional transportation when preferred.\r

The location was great it was close to the MTR/public transportation, restaurants, market, etc... The only con to the location is that it was a little hard to get a taxi because coming out of the building cars are not allowed to stop in that area so you would have to walk a bit when taking/coming from a taxi. This has nothing to do with wilson but I thought I would mention it anyways the elevator in this building is extremely slow. The apartment was decent, it didn't wow me or anything but as expected places in HK are small. For a group of 9 it was a bit tight but that didn't bother us since we were out most of the time. The apartment looks pretty much like the pictures there is one thing I would like to say is I wish Wilson would have taken pictures of the second bathroom to his place kus it was tiny. I'm a really tiny girl and even I had a hard time in there. So that probably would have changed my mind on picking his place to stay because we were really looking for a 2 bathroom place.

I could even partly see New Years fireworks from windows. 

Apartment concierges were at a ground floor 24 hours. They open the entrance door when you come home. Some of them can communicate in English. They are all kind and helpful.

Carmen was super kind and communicative host. Her indication was accurate and helpful. She kindly left an octopus card for visitors to charge and use. 

There is a washing machine in a listing but HongKong was too humid to dry laundry fast.  You can use a laundry shop next to the apartment. They wash and clean your laundry in a day.

The location was only a few minutes from a tram station. 
Walkable distance from Central and Causeway Bay. 

There are many towns in HongKong but I am totally satisfied with staying in Wanchai. 
Wanchai has modern skyscrapers, hipster attractions, and daily local markets and small restaurants.  St Francis street looked very sophisticated and I didn\u2019t feel unsafe. In front of the apartment, there are rainbow stairs which looks like an Instagram shooting spot and a lot of foreign people were taking photos.

There are, however, two downsides: the apartment is not equipped with an airconditioner or fan (which is not disastrous, but it can get pretty hot if you're not used to Portugese summers), and sounds from upstairs neighbours and the busy road it lies on can be heard at night. If you're a light sleeper, I suggest taking soundproof earplugs with you.

Tarek was a superb host -- he was very kind and communicative with us from the get-go and was flexible to some logistical issues we had. He even gave us "must-see" and "must-eat" tips and overall made us feel very welcome on our first visit to Montreal. We would definitely stay here again in the future.

We had a fantastic week in Maui with Ma'alaea as our home base. Restaurants and shops and aquarium are walkable, and most of the spots on the island you want to be at are no more than 20 minutes away by car. We found the location so convenient and flexible, and were able to do everything we wanted. 

The space is even nicer than it looks in the photos, immaculately kept and with everything you could want. It even has tons of goodies for cooking - salts and spices and even olive oil! The box of beach goodies - chairs, boogie boards, a cooler - were super handy and we used them a ton, saved us money too. 

If you're worried about not having a beach view, don't be. The mountain view is gorgeous, and you can walk to the beach in minutes.

When i check the location, had to cancel and rushed to my ultimate accommodation portal, broadcasting generic message to nearby hosts to secure an accommodation the soonest.\r
\r
Alison was among the first to reply, and to pre-confirm...\r
By the time i got there, Adam was already waiting for me and even kind enough to give me all the directions at 8am and off course waited for me outside to make sure that i'm paying the right cab fee. \r
\r
What can i say Adam, made feel at home from very first moment, kind, genuine and warm welcoming host. The house is is really nice fully refurbished, in a quite and well connected neighbourhood. My room was upstairs, a nice sunny room with  a queen bed and a bathroom attached. After i dropped in my luggage, Adam gave me guided orientation tour to the house, with access to all amenities. \r
\r
Felt like a VIP 5 star treatment as Adam even gave me a pre-paid bus ticket, which made my first(s) bus rides easier as some stations are pre-paid only.  So now that you that i have been at a great apartment, with great hosts, that's all, Rozelle is a really nice neighbourhood. walking distance from my hosts' place, you can make it to the main street packed, with cafe, bars and restaurant, a vibrant market and lot of attractions. if you happen to stay over a weekend don't miss Rozelle Market (Sat & Sun). \r
\r
Now the funny part, Adam was so happy to receive me as he's a all star backgammon player and he knows that Lebanese people are really good at that and he was so eager for round. One night we decided to play a round and Adam's expectations went all down the drain, i think i was the first Lebanese ever to be clumsy backgammon player. We agree that we will play another time via (Hidden by Airbnb) and i will have support from fellow Lebanese players :)\r
\r
All in all, i great time, the house is warm, clean, and comfortable and the hosts are simply AWESOME  \r

 \r
The appartment is newly renovated, with modern furniture and a beautiful old tiled floor and stucco work in some of the rooms.\r
 \r
The automatic air conditioning for manual temperatur setting is very comfortable.\r
The conservatory (winter garden) is a additional room with a view in the courtyard (the view is not very spectacular but it is very comfortable there). Since the appartment is in the city center there is no fabulos view from none of the windows - but this does not matter at all.\r
 \r
There is also a Nespresso coffee machine in the modern kitchen (bring the capsules by your one or there is a Nespresso shop 100m away).\r

Das Appartment ist in unmittelbarer N\xE4he vom \xF6ffentlichen Verkehr und der grossen Einkaufsstrasse "Passeig de Gr\xE0cia" mit unz\xE4hligen L\xE4den, Cafes und Restaurants.\r
\r
\r
\r
\r
Ideal f\xFCr einen Sightseeing-Aufenthalt in Barcelona, da zentral gelegen (ca. 10 min zu Fuss zur Pla\xE7a Catalunya, 2 min zum Taxi-Stand und Bus-Haltestellen).\r
\r
\r
Wir waren zu 5. f\xFCr drei Tage in Lluis Wohnung und haben uns sofort sehr wohl gef\xFChlt. Lluis war bei der Schl\xFCssel\xFCbergabe bereits vor Ort und hat uns gute Tipps f\xFCr Barcelona gegeben. \r
\r
\r
\r
Die Wohnung ist neu renoviert, modern eingerichtet und hat wundersch\xF6ne alte B\xF6den und Stuckaturen in manchen Zimmern.\r
\r
Es hat eine automatische L\xFCftung: Die Temperatur kann manuell eingestellt werden (sehr angenehm).\r
\r
Der verglaste Raum (\u201EWintergarten\u201C) ist ein zus\xE4tzlicher Raum mit Aussicht auf den Innenhof (die Aussicht ist jetzt nicht wirklich atemberaubend, aber es ist sehr gem\xFCtlich). Eine sch\xF6ne Aussicht gibt es von keinem Fenster aus, da sich die Wohnung Mitten in der Stadt befindet - St\xF6rt aber nicht.\r
\r
Es hat eine Nespresso-Kaffee-Maschine (Kapseln selber mitbringen oder 100m von der Wohnung gibt\u2019s einen Nespresso-Shop).\r
\r
\r
Wir k\xF6nnen die Wohnung und Lluis als Gastgeber nur weiterempfehlen.\r
\r
Muchos gracias Lluis!!!\r

Excellent location if you prefer a quiet neighborhood. There is quite a number of restaurants and shops close by and it is only two blocks away to Central Park. Public transportation is within walkable distance too. 
Please note that you will need to buy some necessities such as trash bags, shampoos and so on as this is not an apartment that someone currently lives in (more of a hotel style with an empty furnished room). Also the streets could be a little loud at night because it faces to Madison Avenue. The service calls were handled promptly. Check in and out were easy. 
Overall I enjoyed my stay at this apartment and would recommend it to anyone who prefers a convenient location but not right into midtown where the traffics are. `},{at:"2017-03-14T04:00:00.000Z",by:{_id:"622f3407e36c59e6164fbece",fullname:"Ariana",imgUrl:"https://robohash.org/53353254?set=set1",id:"53353254"},txt:"This apartment is perfect for one person or couples staying in NYC for a long period and looking to experience the real Upper East Side, with its beautiful residences, shops and restaurants. The location is prime, very easy to hop on a bus or subway and make it anywhere. Nightlife is not big around, it's actually quiet and nice at night. Dave from USA Stay was super nice and helped solving certain issues that came up. The communication was great. There's a little market and cleaners downstairs, which is super convenient, and a Duane Read/Walgreens a couple of blocks away.

However, be aware that the apartment is old and therefore not well isolated. You hear traffic from Madison Avenue, your neighbours and noisy radiators. Sometimes the water will never get hot, forcing you to take cold showers. Radiators may not work on cold days.
We stayed for two months in a nice location but the apartment disappointed us, especially when we considered the high price of our 2 months stay.`},{at:"2017-08-14T04:00:00.000Z",by:{_id:"622f3404e36c59e6164fb448",fullname:"Adele",imgUrl:"https://robohash.org/17068668?set=set1",id:"17068668"},txt:`The apartment is located at UES, one block from Central Park and within close proximity within several museums (The Met, Guggenheim, Copper Hewitt). Nearest subway station is on either 96th street (6 train) or 86th street (4,5,6 trains).

The apartment is on the third floor of the building. The neighbourhood is generally quiet with the exception of traffic noises and bus noises (there's a bus stop right below) but apart from that it's generally quiet at night. 

It's a cosy apartment, and has everything you would typically need. The small refrigerator works well, however do note that the freezer section doesn't work, so avoid purchasing items that require freezing. Wifi and cable TV works well too.

I had no problems with the hot water in the shower, but do note that it does take a few minutes for it to get hot. 

Communication was great and the host, he was always quick to respond to questions or any problems. I found them incredibly communicative and helpful. 

I stayed for a period of two months. I am seldom around during the day as I am at work, and am usually only around at night. 

Overall I am satisfied with the apartment and my stay.

First, there are cockroaches. First thing we saw upon entering were cockroaches in the kitchen area - without even having any food around or cooking. This was not properly disclosed before arrival. Although they sent somebody over who laid out baits, the roaches did not disappear. Second, (at least) two times there were unannounced strangers entering the apartment in order to look at it or to even take pictures. We know because we were at the apartment at this time. Third, the apartment faces Madison Ave, so it is rather loud. In addition, the windows are not well sealed so it gets cold/hot easily. Overall, considering what you get, the apartment is overpriced. In addition to get the key, you have to travel across the city to pick it up - very inconveniently."},{at:"2018-11-12T05:00:00.000Z",by:{_id:"622f3403e36c59e6164fb029",fullname:"Fernando",imgUrl:"https://robohash.org/98953924?set=set1",id:"98953924"},txt:`El sitio me pareci\xF3 inmejorable, ni muy c\xE9ntrico, ni muy alejado, y muy buenos transportes p\xFAblicos, metro a 10 min. y autobus a piede casa.

\r
Paul's place is a unique gem decorated with his quirky eye for colour, style and collectible treasures. It has a cozy well decked out living room, a bedroom with a closet and a comfortable bed, spacious bathroom and a nice, sunny, open-plan kitchen surrounded by windows. It is neat and well organised. There is cooling and heating in every room (plus fans), and the kitchen is well stocked with pots, pans, and other requirements along with a nice big fridge and freezer.  We found the place had everything we needed for a comfortable long-term stay.\r
\r
For us, the location so close to three big parks (incl. Central Park), Columbia and Harlem, was just right. There are transport options aplenty: bikes up and down Riverside Park, the 1 MTA line two blocks away and frequent Broadway buses.  Paul kindly lent us his two bikes which was a fab way to get around the city. Being located on the border of UWS is great as it is a relatively quiet area to stay but the rest of Manhattan is readily accessible through the 1 line meaning we got the best of Manhattan action combined with good sleeping!

Since it's a college town, I felt super safe and there were minimal tourists and minimal bums also. A couple things to note: this is actually Paul's residence so there are some personal affects to be mindful of.  I really appreciated that though because I was able to tap into the Tylenol and bandaids in the medicine cabinet over the course of 2 weeks. Hey, anything can happen!

I was visiting my son who is a student there. Even if Columbia wasn't your destination, Paul's apartment is one block from lovely Riverside Park and the Hudson River. Morningside park is a few blocks to the east. Central Park North and Cathedral Parkway are 5-10 minutes away. The 1 train stops 2-4 blocks away. The UWS is very gracious.

He made me tea, fruit and nuts. He gave me plenty of towels and wash clothes. He gave me a shelf in the bathroom for my toiletries. I unpacked, showered (plenty of hot water), and headed out to my first meeting. Paul was lovely to talk to, yet respectful of my privacy. He welcomed both of my young adult children into his home. My daughter (who is graduating from NYU) cooked 2 breakfasts in Paul's kitchen. She so enjoyed his window seat in his kitchen. My son lingered and did schoolwork at the kitchen table. Paul's space was so much more gracious than a dorm room! Paul even printed out my boarding pass when I was out and about. He also printed 36 pages of work that I had completed while spending the day in the libraries at Columbia and the cafes near Columbia while my son wrote a paper.

Once, before our arrival, I mentioned that I like Lilikoi (Passionfruit). When we arrived, Rina had Lilikoi Tea and Jam for us. After couple of days I asked if we could borrow 2 beach chairs, she didn't have any, but guess what? Next day she knocked and had 2 beach chairs on her shoulder, not the flimsy ones, the good ones....we thought that was incredible. The place is not the Hyatt, but comfy and clean. Our room was big enough for us,shower and toilet in the room, all was perfect. We could use the kitchen, which we did every morning. Well, what else is there to say? I told her, whenever we visit Maui, we will stay with her. She gave me/us a bye-bye present: Lilikoi candle, soap and body wash....a Hyatt would not do that !!\r

\r
The flat is very nice and functional furnished. All equipment is very new. The beds have comfortable mattresses in which we could sleep very well. In striking distance you will find bars and shops frequented by residents. Even the view from the small balcony over the roofs of Barcelona is a visit worth. A breath-taking view in Barcelona\u2019s real life!\r

We recommend this apartment without retention and will rent it again for our next stay in this unique town. Thanks, Jon, for making our stay in Barcelona unforgettable!\r

We felt very welcome and comfortable due to Raj's warm hospitality. He sent us a detailed "Welcome Packet" which included very useful tips for our Maui adventure. The condo was 100% clean and included everything one may need to prepare meals and have an enjoyable and relaxing stay. Prior to our arrival, he actually replaced most all the kitchen items such as silverware, dishes, cooking utensils, pots and pans, etc. The furnishings (including the beds) were extremely comfortable and the panoramic view, condo grounds and beach were SPECTACULAR!!!

It has everything you need for a comfortable stay, and the space itself is huge and very well looked after. It was spotless and we felt right at home. There are plenty of beach towels supplied which was very useful and Raj gave us great tips about local places to check out. 

The condo has THE MOST spectacular views of the beach and ocean and we spent a huge portion of our holiday soaking in the sunsets from the balcony. Just incredible. 

We also loved swimming at the beach and happy hour at the restaurant/bar downstairs. 

Can't recommend this place enough, please visit and see for yourself!

As an AirBnB newbie, I wasn't really sure on the protocols for communicating etc. However, Tracy made me feel relaxed and at home. She has a gorgeous, friendly dog and the place is immaculate - she had also left some fresh fruit, juice and water which was super-welcome after arriving on a fairly late flight. All the linens, towels etc were of high quality, and the shower is fantastic!  No air-con, but it's a shady spot and the fan was fine, even on two warm summer evenings.\r

They always responded me in a swift manner with good solutions to all of my minor issues (including the early arrival, coffee machine repair, cleaning service question and light bulb request). 
I liked the apartment very much. It was convenient to do anything in the city and quiet and comfortable to sleep at night. To highlight the convenience, I want to note that the nearest supermarket is just one or two blocks away (to the north) and pubs and restaurants are also a block away (to the south). Some may worry about bugs at such location, but during my 40-day stay, I did not have any bug issues. 
The only possible setbacks I can think of are the tiny kitchen sink and occasional odor from outside. 
The kitchen sink is certainly small although this place has a dishwasher. So, for a short stay and people who do not cook very much will not have any problems. However, if you want to do dishes during your stay, you will probably find the sink space cramped. 
The outside smell was very occasional during my stay in a rainy summer (I think it was related to the weather). When I noticed the weird smell, I just needed to close the windows to shut it out. The AC works very well. So, it was not a big deal for me to do so. 
Overall, I am happy with the values and qualities I got here, and I would highly recommend this place to anybody who wants to enjoy the city activities and have good rests in the same time.`},{at:"2017-03-20T04:00:00.000Z",by:{_id:"622f3404e36c59e6164fb2ed",fullname:"Leon William",imgUrl:"https://robohash.org/120799515?set=set1",id:"120799515"},txt:"Unfortunately very disappointed with the overall listing description which does not accurately reflect any similarities to the actual apartment at all..

Property itself looks even better than in the pictures and it is quite large. House is very nice and you will probably find everything you need even though if you plan to cook every day you might be somewhat limited. Biggest problem we encountered is something that looked cool at the beginning - ducks walking around the property. They would constantly poop at the front deck and the deck would quickly become disgusting and unusable. Even if you wash it out with the hose, it will take them no time to make the mess again. However, somehow they decided to leave the back (ocean side) deck alone so we were able to truly enjoy the beautiful view.  I would recommend the place to couples or families with older children - not babies or small kids as the bedrooms are awkwardly placed (one is right at the entrance door) so you have to walk through the whole house to get to second bedroom. The host vas very helpful and responded quickly to all our questions.

You will be greeted by the birds on the property every morning they are so friendly and will come right up to you.
Kristine is an amazing and thoughtful host they have thought of everything and have a binder filled with info about the house places to visit and places to eat be sure to look thru it because it sent us some amazing places we never would have thought about otherwise.
There are tons of amenities for the water on the back deck, a cooler cane in handed for day trips to the beach, aloe and aftersun lotion for those sunburn recovery days, all bathroom amenities you could ever need of vacation.

If you stay here, be sure to check out Dim Dim Sum and the Biang Biang noodles at Yau Yuen Siu Tsui (a michelin guide restaurant just across the street from the apartment)-- the best noodles I've ever eaten. 

The apartment is small but nicely furnished. Very clean. One thing to note is that the small kitchen has a stovetop and microwave, but no oven. Perfect for cooking a simple breakfast, but not really set up to cook an elaborate meal.

I'd definitely recommend this apartment as a great place to stay in Hong Kong, especially if you're looking for a less touristy location. `},{at:"2017-07-25T04:00:00.000Z",by:{_id:"622f3401e36c59e6164fab84",fullname:"Cindy",imgUrl:"https://robohash.org/52333964?set=set1",id:"52333964"},txt:"Spacious and extremely conveniently located.

Me and my family had a comfortable stay. Jesse and Kris have been very responsive to my concerns and made sure things were properly communicated. 

Special thanks to Kris who has been so accommodating and approachable.

Good points:
1) Apartment is conveniently located near MTR exit (less than 5-min walk)
2) A nearby supermarket to get your daily needs like water
3) A LOT of restaurants nearby including local eateries. There's even a Korean resto! (Seng Seng)
4) Strong water supply with instant hot water
5) Comfy beds and pillows
6) Well-equipped kitchen with a complete set of glassware
7) Umbrellas. It was raining on our 2nd day and the umbrellas came in handy.

Room for improvement:
1) Directions on how to get to the meeting place e.g. which exit to take from MTR exit as there were lots of exits
2) Standardised ON/OFF light switches
3) Working clock in at least one of the rooms, if not all

Thanks again Jessa and Kris! We would definitely recommend your apartment/s to our families and friends.`},{at:"2017-10-04T04:00:00.000Z",by:{_id:"622f3402e36c59e6164facbd",fullname:"\u5A77\u5A77",imgUrl:"https://robohash.org/149924662?set=set1",id:"149924662"},txt:"The apt is in the residental area but still near the metro station.

The internet worked well and her rooftop terrace was pleasant for afternoon tea and breakfast.  In fact, Nuria offered us tea on the roof upon our arrival.

(Pod\xE9is encontrar info sobre restaurantes en esta p\xE1gina (Website hidden by Airbnb) \r

Ubicado a 10min de la Casa de la M\xFAsica, donde la oferta cultural es amplia, y del Mercado del Bom Sucesso (opci\xF3n ideal para picar algo cerca del apartamento aunque no la \xFAnica). \r
Al centro normalmente \xEDbamos andando (alrededor de 20min) pero otra opci\xF3n es coger el metro desde el centro y andar los \xFAltimos minutos; el trayecto que realizamos fue: De Sao Bento>Trindade> Casa da Musica (Carolina Michaelis tambi\xE9n est\xE1 cerca).\r
\r
La opci\xF3n m\xE1s corta para ir andando (o eso nos parece) es Dr Carlos Cal Brandao (e ir callejeando) aunque tambi\xE9n se puede ir hacia la Rotonda de Boavista y bajar hacia Jardins do Palacio de Cristal (buena opci\xF3n para ver atardecer).\r

Lamentablemente, es dif\xEDcil llevarse una imagen positiva despu\xE9s de que te roben. El d\xEDa antes de nuestra partida encontramos la luna del coche rota, y todo lo que hab\xEDa de valor, sustra\xEDdo. Es una pr\xE1ctica habitual, no fue una excepci\xF3n. La consiguiente desesperaci\xF3n, al estar "abandonados" en otro pa\xEDs, s\xF3lo la conoce quien la padece. Adem\xE1s, no hab\xEDamos aparcado en una zona  conflictiva, sino en un barrio residencial, muy cerca del apartamento. 
Lo verdaderamente problem\xE1tico no es el robo en s\xED, sino el hecho, ante la perspectiva de un largo viaje para volver a casa, de no tener ayuda posible: que el seguro no responda, no tener internet en el tel\xE9fono, etc\xE9tera, hecho que probablemente constituya un incentivo para los ladrones, pues es obvio que act\xFAan desde el rencor.
Si Margarida dispone el aparcamiento trasero a la casa todo ser\xE1 m\xE1s seguro. No le recomiendo a nadie dejar el coche en la calle.
Es recomendable tambi\xE9n, controlar los precios de las tarifas de datos, ya que la Wi-Fi que nos fue brindada solo funcion\xF3 el primer d\xEDa, y se hace muy necesaria estando de viaje. 
Por otro lado, es dif\xEDcil llegar a entender para un espa\xF1ol (que tenemos fama de fiesteros y gritones) como es posible que en una zona residencial todas las noches se re\xFAna gente en una plaza a beber y hablar hasta las cuatro o cinco de la ma\xF1ana. El caso es que como la visita ha sido en agosto y el calor era insoportable, ten\xEDamos que tener las ventanas abiertas y era muy dif\xEDcil dormir, pues la gente no ten\xEDa ninguna consideraci\xF3n ni civismo en este aspecto.
Esto no pretende ser una cr\xEDtica destructiva; quiz\xE1 tuvimos mala suerte, y aunque creo que hay aspectos a mejorar, el apartamento es una  buena oportunidad para conocer la ciudad, sobre todo por su relaci\xF3n calidad-precio y porque Margarida responde siempre con una sonrisa. Aun teniendo en cuenta los aspectos se\xF1alados, estoy seguro de que con el tiempo el recuerdo ser\xE1 bueno.`},{at:"2016-08-12T04:00:00.000Z",by:{_id:"622f3402e36c59e6164fadec",fullname:"M\xE9lanie",imgUrl:"https://robohash.org/55254902?set=set1",id:"55254902"},txt:"Un tr\xE8s bon accueil de la part de Margarida.

My girlfriend and I had a fantastic stay in Willy's apartment and we wish we could return.\r
\r
We booked this place almost last minute as I had to move to New York to start a job and look at apartments. We're glad we went with this one. It is half a block away from the R and only a few blocks from basically every other subway line worth having in Brooklyn. We could be in Manhattan in a minute's notice. \r
\r
It is only a few blocks away from Montague St, the short shopping street in the middle of Brooklyn Heights, and a little farther away from Court St, the main shopping street this side of the Gowanus Canal. In short, the location is ideal. Don't pass this place up.\r
\r
The apartment itself is spacious and light. The main room/bed room has two windows on three of its four walls and is constantly filled with light. The girl who lives there is a photographer, and it is obvious that she cares about the quality of the light in the room. To top it off, the apartment is appropriately accented with a few mirrors, which brightens the space even more. The bed, with its foam and vinyl mattress, is an absolute pleasure to sleep on. \r
\r
Those who come to New York fearing about grime and pests need not be afraid of this apartment. It is kept immaculately clean, and we stayed there ten days without seeing even a single fly. \r
\r
Sheets and towels are provided, as well as a mostly empty closet and lots of reading material. The internet in the apartment has its ups and downs, but is mostly and unfortunately fairly slow.\r
\r
Again, you would be a fool to pass this place up, especially at this price. `},{at:"2011-08-23T04:00:00.000Z",by:{_id:"622f3404e36c59e6164fb4c4",fullname:"Lucas",imgUrl:"https://robohash.org/926181?set=set1",id:"926181"},txt:`Nice, clean and quiet apartment in one of the most beautiful neighborhoods in NY.

\r
Second, the apartment is a lovely alternative to getting a hotel.  While there were a couple of quirks, they weren't substantial in any way and the price was more than 50% less than nearby hotels.  The lighting in the place is stunning and the building tends to be very quiet.  Getting the keys was not a problem.  We had a bit of trouble getting in to the building a couple of times, but that was resolved with the help of a friendly neighbor who was our designated contact since the host is away.  The door to the apartment was a difficult to unlock as well, but that may have been my error.\r

But it is the perfect setup and the PERFECT location if you want to be in the heart of Brooklyn Heights. There is a desk in the bedroom and an Internet connection (not perfect, but mostly worked) so I was able to get some work done too.  Willy was delightful to interact with - accommodating and prompt. After exchanging mobile numbers, we were able to text back and forth, which is very efficient. The bathroom sink turned out to be completely clogged but Willy got a plumber to fix it the next day.

This is probably due to the fact the one of the window fixture in the bedroom is an open blind, offering great air flow but not much in noise reduction.

This is our first AirB&B rental and we were pleasantly surprised! The views of the ocean were amazing, the resort is well kept and the landscaping is beautiful. Turtles were in the ocean at the edge of the property every morning, and we were usually able to scurry down with coffee or a mimosa and watch them swim and come up for air. The pool was rarely, if ever, used during our stay, so you could have it all to yourself. The BBQ are was clean and well-kept. This condo is on the third floor with stairs up, so if you have physical limitations it might be a struggle. However, the third floor placement allows for extremely quieter accommodations and an unparrelleled view of the ocean. The bedroom is on the street side, so road noise does creep in during the evenings. We easily slept and the noise didn't bother us at all. The fans and open windows kept us cool during the evenings with no need for AC (this unit does not have it). Although we didn't meet Ken in person, he provided us with all the information we needed to enjoy the condo without worry. This place is well stocked, clean and convenient.

Two advisories: the condo is on the small side for more than two people, although it can technically sleep four (two in the real bed and two on the pullout couch), and careful with parking here because other guests and owners can get a bit possessive, especially if they have large cars. Also, you definitely should have a car if you stay here because while a few markets/delis and shops are walkable, the town of Lahaina is not.

The apartment is just like in the photos, though it is hard to capture how awesome it is to sit on the terrace and watch the birds and (on some nights) fireworks in the sky.

The air conditioning is in two rooms, the living/dining room and the master bedroom. This was plenty for the time we were there, but I bet it gets hot in August in the smallest bedroom. The kitchen could use a few more plates and utensils, as a family of four ended up doing lots of dishes, but that is minor.
The neighborhood is quite nice, shops and restaurants and groceries everywhere. The buses, tram, and taxis are at most a couple of blocks away, and the subway an extra block in the other direction. Very convenient and perfect for families.

We arrived at the flat and were met by Lola (the building guard) who gave us the keys and showed us around the apartment. It was perfect. Clean and tastefully decorated with all the kitchen appliances you could need! \r
We chose the apartment for the balcony and views and were blown away. You can see the whole of Barcelona from the balcony, all the way to the sea. Perfect for a sunny evening with a bottle of wine! The best thing about the balcony is that you are not overlooked by anyone. It is completely private and being so high up you are not disturbed by the noise of the road. \r
The flat itself is about a 10 minute walk from the metro station Guinardo and it's only a couple of minutes on the metro into town. The metro shuts around midnight so a few late nights we treated ourselves to a taxi back which cost about $11.\r
Lots of little supermarkets nearby to stock up and also several nice bars and cafes if you dont fancy the journey into town. \r
All in all was a perfect trip. Fantastic apartment which was great value for money. Would 100% recommend Enriques apartment and will certainly be staying again in the future.  `},{at:"2013-08-13T04:00:00.000Z",by:{_id:"622f3402e36c59e6164fac06",fullname:"Yarik",imgUrl:"https://robohash.org/7543271?set=set1",id:"7543271"},txt:"Really, amazing views!

During my starving was around 35C in Rio so I spend a good time in the pool which is very deep, clean and enjoyable. Tivesse so good I barely went to the gym which is literally minutes away. 

Cesar was super kind, he is definitely not your regular Airbnb host. As he knows I like to cook potatoes he showed me how to cook Mandioca Brazilian potatoes with shrimps. It was an unforgettable cooking and gastronomic experience. 

I will certainly come back again next time I am in Ipanema. `},{at:"2017-01-21T05:00:00.000Z",by:{_id:"622f3402e36c59e6164fac78",fullname:"Dudu",imgUrl:"https://robohash.org/71799343?set=set1",id:"71799343"},txt:"Excelente localiza\xE7\xE3o, seguro e tranquilo.

Patricia is a fabulous host and she even provided us with a baby cot and a baby chair for our son, so we didnt have to worry about that. That made the trip a lot more relaxing. \r

If you plan to do more cooking, the kitchen could need a bit more equipment and we could for example only find 2 wine glasses and a limited number of kitchen utensils, but we nevertheless managed. \r

We were specifically looking for a quiet place not far from the center.  And we realized that it was quite difficult to find such place in Barcelona.  But Patricia's apartment was exactly what we were looking for.  It's located in Gracia disctrict which is 5 minutes walk from Passage de Gracia (one of the main streets of Barcelona which brings you to the Cataloniya square).  But at the same time it's a district where local people leave and it has a charm old Barcelona - historical buildings, nice cosy squares full of life, plenty of food shops and even market with fresh sea food, vegetables and Spanish specialities.  This is exactly the place where you can feel the real, not turistic Barcelona.  We felt very comfortable and safe there.  The apartment is simple but has everything you need - 2 big comfortable bads, kitchen with oven, microwave and all the necessary utensils.  There is also washing machine but we did not use it.  In one of sleeping rooms there is a small cosy balcony where you can enjoy your glass of wine or breakfest.  Due to the fact that both sleeping-rooms windows looks to the patio, it's absolutely quiet at night.  And you can only hear a sound of old clock which goes from the clocktower on the neighboring square which is the main square of Gracia district.  That gives you a wonderfull feeling of being in another century.  So, we got all we have expected and even more:).  And Patricia was also great as host.  We had only one problem with wi-fi in the first day which she fixed immediately that day.  It was very easy and comfortable for us to communicate with Patricia.  So, we would recommend her appartment to those who want to enjoy real Barcelona in a comfortable and quiet way:).

The only suggestion would be for the concierge management, in that we were booked for a 15:30 check- in and were left waiting outside until 16:20 on the footpath/sidewalk until Louisa from the management company arrived, I understand traffic can be a problem, but would have appreciated a text or phone call as to the delay. I had to message the management service to find out any information and was only told someone was on the way - but no time indication.
We asked where would we find a grocery store and again Louisa did not have this information, nor recommendations. 
The door to the apartment jammed and she could not get it opened, luckily my husband was able to 'pound' on the door to help us get in. When we tested the door to get out of the apartment again, she was unable to open the door. If my husband had not been with me, I or any women would not be able to get in or out of the apartment. Louisa said she would report this problem and hopefully, it will be resolved before the next people arrive. 
I would recommend this apartment when visiting Porto for location, and general facilities in the apartment. `},{at:"2016-08-25T04:00:00.000Z",by:{_id:"622f3406e36c59e6164fba14",fullname:"Giovanni",imgUrl:"https://robohash.org/19772099?set=set1",id:"19772099"},txt:`Isabella and her team are very professional and provided us any support and help.\r

2. Under the house rules, the host requests to empty out the trash. It has been indicated that there is always a garbage deposit in the street nearby.

I even walked to Leblon from there in under 40 minutes. 

The hosts met me up front and helped me with my luggage. They don't speak English, but are very charming and helpful, so we communicated via (Hidden by Airbnb) Translate, using (Hidden by Airbnb) .

The building is slightly older. One day there was no water in the building due to maintenance. The hosts warned me about this, there was nothing they could do and I was prepared. Only issue is that after the water came back, because of the older pipes, it was brown for a little while, just have to let the taps run for several minutes. 

The bed isn't the most comfortable for an extended stay (I was there for eight nights), but for short durations it's fine. 

There is a washing machine in the apartment, it works great, I dried my clothes by hanging them on chairs, hooks, etc. 

The WiFi is strong and reliable. 

There is a grocery store and a couple of reasonably priced restaurants on the block, as well as two different banks. Excellent for visitors. A drug store is also available on the next block at the corner. 

Overall the inconveniences were small and the positives of this location was great. `},{at:"2016-09-30T04:00:00.000Z",by:{_id:"622f3402e36c59e6164fae0d",fullname:"Maureen",imgUrl:"https://robohash.org/81173012?set=set1",id:"81173012"},txt:"Ana and Jose were wonderful hosts.

I was pleased with the location directly across the street from the water (not a swimming beach but a couple-minute drive to several great sandy beaches).  Fine food options nearby.

She responded to everything and does actually live close by (a good thing too, because the door code wasn't working when we arrived, but it was quickly addressed).  She was also helpful in giving us a bit of extra time for check-out.

Just to say a couple things about the actual condo, the pictures do portray it in the best possible light.  Nothing deceptive, but there are elements that could use updating that are not shown.  The bathrooms need some TLC and there are lots of wires and cords everywhere (especially the bedrooms).  Everything else was clean and safe.  The kitchen is up-to-date with every appliance you should need, including a blender and toaster.  There is a newer washer and dryer right in the unit, which is very convenient.  We didn't use the TVs, but there are 3 of them - one in the main living room and one in each bedroom.  Parking was very convenient - a reserved spot that's just steps away from the ground level entrance (the condo is on the ground level and doesn't have any stairs).  There are several beach accessories waiting as well - a cooler, beach chairs and boogie boards are there for your use, along with plenty of beach towels.  There are 3 AC units and all of them worked, but they are noisy.

The noise level outside was generally good.  There were a few inconsiderate very early morning departures from other units, but nothing major.  The park across the road closes at 8pm, so there was no late-night noise to speak of.

The location in general is great.  The park across the road is not a swimming beach (no sand, too many rocks), but it's very popular for surfing and paddleboarding lessons.  There are several sandy beaches just a short drive (or healthy walk) away.  Kihei in general is a great spot to stay, as it's near several  great beaches (Big Beach in Makena is epic) and is central to a lot of things you'll want to see - the upscale Wailea area is just a short drive away and several other destinations are easily driveable from Kihei.  There are lots of food choices close by and many of them offer some of the best value you'll find in Maui.  There's also 2 supermarkets right down the road (and Foodland is open until 1am).

To summarize, the condo was more "rustic" than we were expecting, but I will say that in the area, you'd likely have to pay a bit more for something more updated that has 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms.`},{at:"2017-09-15T04:00:00.000Z",by:{_id:"622f3405e36c59e6164fb7d1",fullname:"International Theatrical",imgUrl:"https://robohash.org/24734634?set=set1",id:"24734634"},txt:"Wonderful host great location"},{at:"2017-10-11T04:00:00.000Z",by:{_id:"622f3405e36c59e6164fb867",fullname:"Michael",imgUrl:"https://robohash.org/78286024?set=set1",id:"78286024"},txt:"Jennifer's place has everything you need in the perfect location.

There are so many details -- from the art on the walls to the spices in the kitchen -- that make it feel like a home away from home. The apartment is small but imminently comfortable with high ceilings and patios that make it feel spacious. The unit is off the street (on a courtyard)  so it was very quiet (that  and the comfortable bed made for great nights of sleeping). It's a beautiful street, just off Central Park and just around the corner from the subway. There are abundant restaurants within a 5 minute walk and the best coffee in NY (Joe's) is only about two blocks away. Chas was a great host who was quick to answer all our questions and make our stay as enjoyable as possible. We had our two sons with us (ages 10 and 12) and the living arrangements were ideal for a family our size.

The apartment is in a great location, half a block from Central Park and close to several subway lines. Only up one flight of stairs, which was good because there are no lifts! \r
The apartment was very well equipped with everything you need for a stay away from home - bedding, towels, full kitchen etc. It was a bit smaller than it appears in the photos and could do with a lick of paint, but was very clean and had plenty of storage. Also, keep in mind that the beds in the loft may provide a bit of a problem for some guests - definitely best for kids. \r

The upper West Side felt very safe at all times and the apartment was on the same block for the subway stops for B and C trains and a short walk to restaurants / cafes on Columbus and Amsterdam.

Sophie has decorated it tastefully and with a lot of thought, providing a lovely selection of art and deign oriented coffee table books for you to peruse. \r
\r
Location wise it\u2019s perfect, being a 5 min walk from the Sagrada Familia and there are a number of nice bars and restaurants in the direct vicinity of the apartment. It is also within easy reach of two central metro lines although we never once used public transport instead opting to rent bikes from a nearby rental shop (Barcelona is simply one of the best cities to ride in with you pretty much never having having to ride on the road ever!). In any case the main sites of the city are all within easy reach on foot. Its\u2019s a 20 min walk to Place de Catalunya and Gothic Quarters and we very much enjoyed our gentle stroll\u2019s home after a night of eating and drinking. \r

Sophie herself could not have been more accommodating. She\u2019s was great to communicate with on the lead up to our stay and welcoming on our arrival. We didn\u2019t want for anything on the trip at all. \r

The heating system was very efficient and no problems with hot water supply.  Fully double-glazed windows and bedroom windows are double-double glazed so no problem with road noise.  Although only on the first floor there is a small lift for those who may find it difficult to climb stairs with a suitcase.

For those interested, the apartment is directly opposite the Egyptian Museum.

Heike was a friendly and efficient host and solved a problem with one of the keys overnight for us.

We really enjoyed our stay at Vela apartment and would recommend to others seeking a classy apartment in a great location in this amazing city.

Hope you will have an awesome stay at our place. Aside from keeping things clean and not screaming after midnight, we don't have many rules. Here are however the things you should pay attention to: 1 - Whenever you leave the house, please make sure the windows and back door are closed and locked. 2 - The front door can be a bit hard to shut so make sure to give it the extra push or pull so that it locks properly. 3 - There is a washer and dryer downstairs in the basement, which you can access through the living room. The basement light switches are on the pillar, situated at the bottom of the stairs on the left.

Luckily, I have more space. \r
\r
The room is just as the pictures display: huge, clean, and comfy! There's a 2persons bed, a build-in closet, another closet with drawers, a book case, a big desk, and a comfy sofa to relax on. Although the room offers more space than you probably need, you can also just hang out in the cozy living room. But the best place has to be the back yard, which Laura turned in a little green oasis. It's the ideal spot to relax after a long day, enjoy the sun, or have a home dinner. And no need to feel lonely as Lulu - a.k.a. the most adorable cat ever - and his buddies from the block are always around somewhere (especially if you give them some of your ham sandwich or sushi). \r
\r
I've stayed at Laura's for several months and I've never felt so at home in another person's house. Laura went above and beyond to make my stay as pleasant as possible. I was new to Montreal (actually I was new to Canada) and didn't know any people other than a few colleagues. Laura embraced me as a friend and made sure I never had to feel alone or get bored, while also giving me all the privacy I wanted. \r
\r
The neighbourhood has everything you need. The house is near  shops, supermarkets, cafe's, restaurants, parks (including the Mont Royal), several busstops, 2 metro stations (Laurier & Mont Royal; both 10 min walking distance), and there's and there's always some fun - often free - festival around the corner in the summer. Despite all this the street is actually really quiet and is very safe!\r

I didn't even rent a car, took an economical shuttle (Robert's) from the airport and used the city bus (a couple blocks away) to get to other parts of the island. Max $4/day for unlimited bus rides and no parking hassles what-so-ever!  (Read reviews for car rental at OGG and you'll find another great reason for going car-free! Not recommended, however, if you wish to do inner island sight-seeing such as Haleakala or Road to Hana.) There is parking under the building.

Safeway is 2 blocks away and fabulous Baby Beach is a 10 minute walk. BTW, Baby Beach is spectacular. Easily the clearest water I've ever snorkeled in. Swim between circular coral outcroppings to see tropical fish and sea turtles. At low tide, wade out hundreds of yards and the water is not even waist high.  Kaanapali Beach - miles of sand, waves and tiki bars is just a half hour walk north or 12 minute bus ride. Easy to get to Black Rock for more superior snorkeling.

Comfortable Murphy bed in the living room lets you sleep to gentle breezes and the sound of the ocean. Nice (and very clean) pool area overlooking the ocean is the perfect spot to see sea turtles feeding at dawn and dusk. Very helpful manager on site who will take you out snorkeling, if you just ask.

Every appliance and amenity you need for a relaxing vacation.  Can't wait to go back!`},{at:"2018-05-28T04:00:00.000Z",by:{_id:"622f3404e36c59e6164fb36b",fullname:"Courtney",imgUrl:"https://robohash.org/64791892?set=set1",id:"64791892"},txt:"An outstanding place to enjoy Maui!

This part of Brooklyn is what New York is all about, a real mix, I would recommend it to anyone that is deciding between staying in  Manhattan or elsewhere outside the big apple. Jon has been very responsive throughout the period we secure the property. Even when his oven stopped working - which was a big deal for us - he told us in advance and managed to secure an alternative, which we finally decided not to use (hope that's ok Jon). My only comment that I think could improve anyone's stay in the future is a mini map of the house pointing to where the basics are, what to use and what not to. It is almost self intuitive, but for someone that was using the service for the first time, I had lots of questions at the very beginning.

There is no hairdryer or air conditioning (this will make it v hot in the height of summer) and the oven is complicated to work.

Aliona is a nice, cheerful and friendly person, extremely helpful. It gives tips on how to navigate the city.\r
The apartment is clean and tidy, comfortable bed, clean sheets and towels.\r
You can freely enjoy the spacious kitchen to prepare meals.\r
The building has a lift and not have to carry luggage.\r
The apartment is located in an ideal spot. The main street of La Rambla (we go straight to the green metro line), you can walk in 5 minutes to the port of the same.\r
To Catalunya can be reached on foot in 10 minutes. Close to the charming Gothic Quarter.\r

Before I started with the inside of the apartment, like any property the most important is location, location and location. Evan & Maria's apartment is located at the heart of Manhattan. It is a walking distance to the Rockefeller Plaza and also to Times Square. There are several restaurants near the apartment and a deli just around the corner to get anything you wanted. 

Okay, now we begin with the apartment. It is very beautiful. Not only you can get anything you wanted but also you can tell the owner put a lot of their heart in to it. It is beautifully decorated and also very clean. 

On a personal note, we have the booking wrong, so we have to checked out a day earlier than we intended to. Evan and Maria were very nice and courteous about it. He texted us to let us know that we have to check out and patiently await our arrival, since we're on a ferry to Liberty Island, and help us find a hotel to move.

All and all it was a great experience even with the moving around and one thing for sure, if I ever in NY I will most definitely try to book Even and Maria super homey apartment.

Thank you Evan & Maria and good luck with the baby ...

She was warm and welcoming in all communication, even texting us during our stay to see if we needed anything.\r
   I gave her 3 stars for a couple reasons, some out of her control.  Her place is charming, but lacks air conditioning.  I'm from the Central Valley of CA & know heat, but the place is too hot to be in from 12-5pm, even with the drapes closed & the fans on high.  This meant we often could not eat lunch at the apartment & had to eat in town or take something in the morning when we left.\r
  The upstairs neighbor also has a loud, aggressive, barking dog that we could hear most evenings.  The neighbor also chooses to brush her dog on the balcony, letting the dog hair fall onto Marilyn's patio below, even when we are sitting outside.\r
  The final reason, most evenings we would return to the smell of pot from neighbors.  Some may not mind this, but it bothers me.  \r
  I know most of these are not within Marilyn's control, but they did make our stay less than desirable. As mentioned, she was a pleasant host & quickly responded to any questions we had & made us feel welcome in her home.\r

It was perfect and exactly what we were hoping for. The condo is super clean and Marilyn is wonderful at answering any questions or giving advice! She always got back to me very quickly. 
The location was great. Everything that we wanted to do and had planned was super close to the condo. The beach across the street is great. Just steps from the condo and never over crowded. The little town just down the road has great restaurants and shops to grab some Souvenirs. We would definitely suggest checking out the Paia fish market for lunch/dinner. You can't go wrong grabbing breakfast at the Kihei Cafe. Make sure to get there early and bring cash!! That's all they accept. 
If you head in the other direction towards Waliea-Makena you can go to Makena park. Big beach is located here. It's a beautiful beach. The waves get a little big though, so keep that in mind. 
Marilyn's condo had everything we needed. The view is beautiful. The complex is clean and very quiet. We never saw or heard another person the whole week we were there. It felt like we were the only couple in the complex. Our only concern at first was that there is no AC, but after one night, we quickly realized that it was not needed. Marilyn provides multiple fans and Maui gets very cool at night. With the fan and cool breeze, we slept great!! 
We managed to get around most of the Island while we were in Maui. And honestly, we always found ourselves wanting to go right back to Kiehi! It's a
Very relaxed and laid back community with not an overwhelming amount of touristy activity, which is exactly what we wanted. 
We definitely will be back to Maui and would LOVE to stay at Marilyn's condo again!!!! `},{at:"2016-07-11T04:00:00.000Z",by:{_id:"622f3402e36c59e6164faee8",fullname:"Sheila",imgUrl:"https://robohash.org/62433709?set=set1",id:"62433709"},txt:"Marilyn was an excellent host and we especially appreciated that she responded immediately with any of our questions.

We didn't get to meet the host, Marilyn, but she was in constant communication - and followed up quickly on questions.

The only downsides were:
1. There is no AC. Coming from San Francisco and being used to the cold, the afternoons in the condo despite multiple fans were almost unbearable indoors. 
2. She had some last minute instructions that we were unprepared for (unlisted on her website) regarding guests/visitors.  She did, however, accommodate our request.
3. If you love nuts, and nut products, this is not the place for you. We felt a little restricted in the food we could eat/cook at the condo. I myself have multiple food allergies, and most of my food substitutions come in the form of nuts - which I could not eat while there!

Otherwise, you will have a lot of fun, with pretty much everything you need close by, good internet speed, quiet neighborhood, and clean home. `},{at:"2016-09-20T04:00:00.000Z",by:{_id:"622f3402e36c59e6164fad15",fullname:"Patrick",imgUrl:"https://robohash.org/30249541?set=set1",id:"30249541"},txt:`Prior to arrival Marilyn sent a text message out to me getting me and reminding me of the house rules.

I appreciate immensely that he contacted me several days before my arrival to arrange for key handover. The building is located in a very convenient spot -- eateries, transportation (7-min walk to closest MTR station, a few minutes away on foot from bus 5/5X that goes to Stanley Market or the 100-series buses on Wanchai Rd. that go to the Kowloon side using the tunnel and you'll arrive at Hunghom where you can take the MTR and trains to NWT and China; tramway, and lots of taxis). Despite the various problems re: cleanliness, Stephen was quick to arrange for his maid to show up more than once. And as other guests noted, hard to find a place so conveniently located at this price.

Cons: I would remove the "newly" word from the property's title of "newly decorated apartment". The cleaner obviously did a superficial job only--found dust and tissue bits below the bed and mouldy caulking around the bathroom sink. A working fridge was one of my must-have items, but was disappointed to find the fridge seal was extremely mouldy, including certain parts inside. I guess my biggest surprise is that this room is actually a room within an apartment which is subdivided into five rooms. There is no window as understood through other reviews and confirmation from Stephen, so won't be suitable for those who are claustrophobic, and you'll have to rely entirely on the air conditioning for fresh air. There is, however, a pseudo-window slot that is open to the corridor in the common area. Would have made the space much more homey if there were a small curtain covering this pseudo-window space since it is half-covered by a file folder and you can still see the dirty metal guard and the sheet of dirty plastic with a hole for the air cond. unit exhaust. I was much taken aback by this after seeing the more "modern" amenities, such as the cupboards and bathroom tiles. Another thing that bothered me was the absence of hooks for clothing, except for the three tiny adhesive hooks in the bathroom (but since the shower is in the same space as the toilet, one cannot use these tiny hooks for dry clothing anyways) and the bar on the glass door (but I didn't want to hang too much on it since the bar is against a glass door). Hence, the only chair in the space is hijacked by my clothes. So if you plan to stay there more than a week, you might find it inconvenient. 

All in all, if you don't have a keen eye for cleanliness, you will like this place for its proximity to amenities and quick response from host.

Hint: If you arrive at the building by taxi, give the taxi driver the Wood Road address, but then you'll have to walk to the Heard Street entrance to enter the building since the security code doesn't work on the Wood Road entrance.`},{at:"2018-04-30T04:00:00.000Z",by:{_id:"622f3403e36c59e6164fb2ab",fullname:"Egan",imgUrl:"https://robohash.org/4303794?set=set1",id:"4303794"},txt:"Thanks Stephen for the stay, its been great."},{at:"2018-05-07T04:00:00.000Z",by:{_id:"622f3406e36c59e6164fbc9b",fullname:"Elis",imgUrl:"https://robohash.org/97748974?set=set1",id:"97748974"},txt:"The location was good and there is convenient store located right below the apartment!

The place is very clean, homy feeling. The Subway is less than 100 yards away (about 1/2 hour ride from midtown Manhattan) which is VERY convenient. Neighbourhood ok. At the end of the day is much nicer to come to instead of a "cold" hotel room! The back yard is great for morning / evening coffe or even BBQ (the grill is already there).\r

The house is as it's seen on the pictures. It is pretty good size for three people. My parents slept on the bed and I slept on the couch. I am 180 cm (5' 11'') and fit on the couch and it was pretty comfortable.\r
When we arrived Michelle's house she greeted us right away, took her time to explain how to commute, where to eat and what to do in the city. \r
The location of house is pretty good. It takes 20-30 min with metro to Manhattan downtown, depends on which line you use. You can also take the metro from JFK, otherwise the cab costs  around $50. In the house everything was clean and neat. She also provided us towels for shower etc. Besides that, whenever I texted to Michelle she responded in timely manner, which made everything easier.\r
Honestly, our overall experience was much better than I expected.  Me and my family had a very good time in Michelle's house and NY. If one day I go back to NY, I know where I should stay. \r

She gave us a recommendation on where to get breakfast that turned out great. The place is very clean and neatly decorated. It's literally right off the subway station, so that's a huge plus. We also met her mother, who is a fascinating woman. I highly recommend her place, if you are looking to visit the area.  \r
-- Later Edit:\r
I should mention that her internet is very fast. I don't know what ISP she uses, but it was a joy to go back to a temporary accommodation and know that you are well connected while traveling. I'm not sure of the exact setup, but it appeared that we had a separate modem and router just for us. This was a huge relief. Michelle had the SSID and password printed and ready for guests, so even if you forget to ask, you would still find them in the apartment. Overall, things were very well thought out before hand and Michelle was very proactive with tiny details like this that make all the difference. This was very surprising to me knowing that I'm dealing with an individual and not a company.   `},{at:"2014-01-01T05:00:00.000Z",by:{_id:"622f3403e36c59e6164fb085",fullname:"Aurelie",imgUrl:"https://robohash.org/8672189?set=set1",id:"8672189"},txt:"Michelle was very nice and her flat is very confortable, well located with the subway at the end of the street.

==)positifs: \r
Bon compromis rapport qualit\xE9 / prix. La proximit\xE9 avec une station de m\xE9tro est un plus ainsi que celle de l'\xE9picerie permettant de faire les petites courses pour les repas pris au gite. Michelle est extr\xEAmement accueillante et serviable. \r

==)n\xE9gatifs:\r
bien que situ\xE9 dans un quartier + calme, la chambre donne sur la rue, et les nuits peuvent \xEAtre difficiles pour les oreilles sensibles. le m\xE9tro qui passe dessous est audible, tout comme les avions. mais \xE0 New York , il est difficile de trouver une endroit tr\xE8s calme. NEW YORK reste un environnement urbain et donc globalement bruyant, autant en avoir conscience. \r
Pour une famille de 4, les lits enfants sont dans la pi\xE8ce qui sert de coin jour. Une table et chaises pliantes n\xE9cessitent d'\xEAtre pli\xE9s  pour installer le 4i\xE8me lit et inversement, plier le lit pour prendre les repas. Pour les fran\xE7ais que nous sommes, la table est aussi importante que le lit. \xE7a peut \xEAtre un probl\xE8me. \r
Peu de vaisselle ( verres en plastique) ce qui est un peu dommage mais \xE7a reste un d\xE9tail.\r
Mais quand on vient \xE0 New York, ce n'est pas pour une ballade gastronomique. Nous recommandons vraiment cette adresse. Tr\xE8s bon compromis.\r
La cours arri\xE8re sera appr\xE9ciable pour les p\xE9riodes + douces.\r
\r
English comments:\r
Just returned from NYC where we stayed with our 2 teenagers in Michelle's appartement. We are really delighted .\r
\r
==)positives:\r
Good compromise quality / price ratio . Proximity to a metro station is a must as well as with the grocery store allowing some errands for meals at the appartement. really practical, opened until 21h. Michelle is extremely friendly and helpful.\r
the appartment is simple but  very clean with 4 real comfortable beds.\r
\r
==)negatives:\r
Although located in a quiet neighborhood, the parent room is overlooking the street, and the nights can be difficult for sensitive ears. Subway is audible,as well as cars & trucks in the street. But to moderate this aspect,  in New York, it's difficult to find a quiet place because it remains a generally noisy urban environment as knowledge.\r
For a family of 4, children beds are in the main room. A table and chairs need to be folded to open beds and vice versa, folding bed for meals. it could be a problem.\r
Very few dishes ( plastic glasses ) which could be improved but it's still a detail.\r
\r
But when we come to visit New York, it is not for gastronomic ballad, and it's important  to find a confortable & clean area. The backyard could be pleasant when the weather allows to use it. Unfortunatelly for us it's was too cold begining of march.\r
We really recommend this address.\r
Many thanks to Michelle.\r

We had several interesting conversations with her and she made us feel welcome right from the start.

The only thing we like to mention for the apartment that is located in a really nice area of Sydney, is that you can only reach it by bus (5 stops) - so there is no tram nearby. The last bus we were able to find to the direction of the apartment left the city at 8:30 pm. That was sometimes a little bit early for us and we had to take an uber (which costs around 20AUD). Everything else was really awesome and we can recommend to stay there for sure.

Close to many bars and restaurants without the noise and crowds of the downtown core of Montreal (which can be reached by foot in 20 - 30 mins or easily via subway)\r
\r
Check in / check out was convenient using a keycode. The apartment had a dishwasher, AC unit, a washer, and dryer. There's also a TV box with Netflix, a nice added touch.\r
\r
Provided free parking in the back of the house was VERY helpful. Finding parking in Montreal can be a huge headache.\r

Kenny was very quick to respond and helped us find an extra parking space for our U-Haul trailer which we had with us as we were moving our son into his apartment for the school year.  \r
\r
The location is perfect, the apartment is large and I especially enjoyed sipping my coffee on the back balcony! Also, the free parking was fantastic for a small/regular sized vehicle. Parking may be too tight for a large SUV. The keyless entry was convenient, and the ac was welcome as it happened to be a hot and muggy couple of days.  Finally, we asked what we should do upon leaving and Kenny quickly wrote back "don't do a thing" and "good luck" to our son. It was a nice, personal touch.`},{at:"2016-08-28T04:00:00.000Z",by:{_id:"622f3407e36c59e6164fbe52",fullname:"Hazel",imgUrl:"https://robohash.org/82896781?set=set1",id:"82896781"},txt:"It was great staying at the heart of Rue St Denis, just 2 blocks from the Metro.

It has two terraces, one over busy St Denis, the other overlooks the backyard.\r
The parking spot is a bit hard to get in and out of. My full size car fit but I had to have my travel partner guide me when leaving the spot. \r
Coffee and bottled water were on hand and a nice touch.\r
The Metro station is very close.\r
I think it would be tight getting 6 people to fit comfortably. One bed is pretty small, 5 would be more accurate.\r
The free WiFi was fast and reliable.\r

\r
We were a group of four and the apartment fit us very comfortably. The rooms are spaced pretty far apart for privacy, which was an added bonus. The bathroom is large and the water pressure in the shower was excellent (it's a pet peeve of mine when pressure is low!).\r

The apartment location is exactly has advertised: close to everything. Another plus is the proximity of an underground parking garage (15\u20AC/day, ask the attendant for coupons). 

We were a family of 4 adults. We found the apartment very well equipped and very spacious. It was clean and everything was in good order. Showers were hot with plenty of pressure. There is a second WC and with 3 women in our group it's a bonus. 

Cristina was a joy to communicate with and she answered all of our questions very rapidly. She was waiting for us when we got there with a smile even though we were late getting there. 

We hope to return one day to Porto to experience it without the rain and we will be staying at Cristina's place again most certainly.

The guest before me needs to check out late so she contacted me the day before I can do the check in between 4PM to 6:30PM. I was enjoying my holiday, I guess I could as the place I stayed before is not far from hers. So I replied yes. Long story short, the following day I got stuck in the traffic and got locked out from the place I stayed before. \r
\r
I was late. \r
\r
Dellasie was not happy, even I apologized. She won't listen to me explain either, "don't argue!" That's what she said\r
\r
I didn't see her much during the days I stayed. She did provide me privacy and a big bed. Thanks.\r
\r
The kitchen sink was always full of dirty dishes, I was not cooking there, just not so pleasant. The neighbour was loud at night, I can hear the TV is on till 2am, but this is New York, which is ok.\r

Generally it is ok, liveable, have privacy, safe area, loads of good restaurants. The host could be more welcoming, which is kind of her job.

From the spacious living areas to the modern decor, Leila's condo is located in a prime spot with spectacular views of the Pacific Ccean. After staying at her place, I wanted to highlight 4 great things about our experience: 

1) Resort amenities- there is a complimentary shuttle that can take you between the Ritz Carlton and Montage resorts from your villa, along with other places in the Kapalua resort. This is great, especially for trying the top rated restaurants at the resorts without having to pay for parking...plus you can have a glass (or bottle) of wine and let someone else worry about the driving :) Or you can walk!

2) Accessibility- Whether you are looking to take in a nice stroll along the beach or play a round of golf, her villa is nestled right in the heart of the Kapalua Resort. Even in the rain, you can enjoy the nice pool with a covered eating area! And I need to mention that the views from her condo are breath-taking, so if you fancy a night in, hers is the place to do it!

3) Her Condo- I've stayed at hotels and resorts before, but I have to say that her villa exceeds anything you can find at a high end resorts. The wi-fi was strong and fast - able to be used among multiple devices. And the entire space was so clean! We had the security of knowing that the crew didn't just do a once over and be done, but actually took the time to make sure that it was ready and prepped for us, as if no one had stayed there before us. I'm a stickler for very nice bedrooms and beds, and hers was not only comfortable, but also offered me a great night's rest after a day of beach, beach and more beach :)

4) Leila & Dan - They have been a gracious host, allowing us to stay at their condo. They were quick to respond, always providing us with best in class service, and were able to provide some great recommendations on activities and events to do on the island. 

I want to thank you for taking the time to read my review. Our experience staying at Leila and Dan's condo was great, and we truly enjoyed the time we spent on Maui. I cannot thank them enjoy for allowing us this great and special opportunity, and for giving us a chance to experience this beautiful island in a way that like no other. For this we are very grateful! 

We wish you all the best in booking your stays through AirBnb and hope you have the opportunity to stay at Leila and Dan's condo... we hope to as well very soon!

The house had an incredible view from both the living room and the bedroom, and while there was an air conditioner, it wasn't needed due to the lovely breeze. The house is walking distance from a small beach, and is a quick drive to the Honolua General Store which has coffee, pastries, sandwiches and hot food, toiletries, towels, sunblock... pretty much everything. 

The house comes equipped with travel size shampoo, body wash, hair conditioner, and bar soap. It also has a small hair dryer.

There are beach umbrellas and chairs in the backyard ready to be taken to the beach.

The wind gusts can get a little loud at times, I think because of how the house is situated on the hill. The bed was a little bit lumpy, but mostly soft and comfortable. The house renovations are gorgeous and look brand new, and there's a huge second bathroom with a great bathtub not pictured in the photos! Very clean, bright, and lovely. As other reviewers said, the photos do *not* do this house justice.

Overall, it was a wonderful place to stay.

When we where at the entrance from Puamana we already had a good feeling. When we where entering to the place from Elise the Puamana Ocean Breeze Bungalow we felt like at home. The place is even better as shown on the picture. It is very clean and tastefully furnished. The kitchen has everything you need to cook. And all the bedrooms are very nice. You got even surfboards or bikes to use. We had every morning our breakfast on the porch which was always a very nice start into the day. From the house you will get in approx. 30\u201C to the ocean where you can enjoy every day the moast romantic sunsets. Its just fantastic. Puamana Ocean Breeze Bungalow is located close to Lahaina where you also find a lot of nice restaurants and grocery stores. And from Puamana you also can do realy nice daytrips like going snorkeling or do the road to Hana, to Wailea Makena or you go to Haleakala where you have a nice few on 10000 Feet over Maui (if the weather is nice) And if you just feel like relaxing than the ocean pool from Puamana is the perfect place just to calm down an enjoy the beauty of the pacific. Right in front of the club house are two surf spots where my son and daughter went surfing every morning. We just can highly recomand this beautiful place and we are still overwhelmed. Thank you so much Elise for having us. You have been always so nice and flexible and did respond very quick to our e-mails and answers. We had a realy great time and we will miss this quiet and romatic place. We just love Maui and all the other Hawaiian Islands. 
Mahalo for everything.

Elise was an ideal host and we had great communication from her and her onsite manager. 
One note - If you are looking for more of a party scene or a place to get a little wild this is probably not a great choice....if you want a sweet peaceful place that's not a pretentious resort, this is for you.

Elise is very very responsive. The guests before us left the place in a mild disarray breaking various items but she let me know as soon as she found out and attempted to fix what she could in one day. She sent us a lovely basket of Maui-an goods to make up for the honestly very minor inconveniences, which was a very nice gesture. Check-in instructions very clear and easy.

The house has a lovely back deck, while although not entirely private as you can see the other neighboring decks, was a nice place to enjoy some meals.  She offers many of the essentials such as a SUP, snorkels, watershoes, boogie boards and a outdoor shower, which made going out to explore the beaches hassle free.

There is no air conditioning, but in the middle of June with the window cracked open and the fan on, it wasn't a real issue.

It's about a 10 minute walk to the subway, depending how fast you walk. We took the subway every day and  got very used to the walk. There aren't many things to do in the area, but with the subway so close, it didn't really matter to us.

At first glance, the neighborhood appeared a little sketchy and run-down, but we never had an issue. It's a very quiet neighborhood with quiet residents who seem to keep to themselves. And the interior of the apartment is very welcoming and well furnished.

All in all, we had a great time and would stay again! Montreal is a beautiful, relaxed city and I recommend it!`},{at:"2017-07-04T04:00:00.000Z",by:{_id:"622f3406e36c59e6164fbbbe",fullname:"Fiona",imgUrl:"https://robohash.org/60354845?set=set1",id:"60354845"},txt:"Sofia's place is money worth for it's value.

The location: very close to MTR station; 7/11 store just down the street (free wifi), a couple of great local restaurants (one offers an awesome 2-person dinner for only 120 HKD, with free wifi), easy access to banks and supermarkets, all within 5-10 minutes walking distance. 

The room: very quiet, clean bedroom and air conditioner (I'm amazed there is no smell at all), comfy living room with kitchen, washing machine (you need that during summer time), and a refrigerator. And you could even find a copy of Animal Farm on the shelf, LOL. This really is what airbnb should offer in the first place, not some small and smelly hostel rooms without a window.

The host: quick response, easy communication, friendly permanent roommate. 

To summarize: awesome place, would definitely come back and also recommend to friends.

Close to the beaches
Quiet
Beautiful garden
Having own Washer and dryer
Beach toys, umbrella, small surf board, beach towels, beach chairs provided

Cons :
Kids under 14 years are not allowed in the hot tub (The policy we received before we got to the condo didn't mention anything about kids not allowed to use the hottub)
The sink and bathtub drains don't work very well
Old and dated property 
Restaurants, grocery stores, coffee shops are in driving distance (you can only walk to the beaches and one Korean restaurant that I wouldn't recommend anyone to go. 
Poor quality kitchen equipment  (if you try to cut or cook anything, it will be challenging)
I broke $40 blender and I got charged for $80.73 for it so don't break anything :) 

This place is ok but not if you have young children. It's more suitable for people without children, retired people. 
Oh, they also don't recycle or compost so if you have any environmental consciousness, it is probably not suitable for you.

Anke was very responsive and nice.
The place is nice and clean.
The condo is right above the pool which was nice.

Cons:
It's a older property which was fine but the condo was old as well.
AC units are on the top floor and middle floor but not in the middle bedroom. Which got hot in the room but it was humid when we stayed at.
There was no sideway outside the resort which was not safe to walk outside.
There were some bikers staying there as well which was loud sometime because of the bike. 

If you to want walk around in Kihei then I would recommend another place near the kamaole beach 1-3.

Overall, it was a ok stay for us but my kids loved the place because they had the upstairs to themselves. Lol

It's a modern 5th floor apartment looking out to the port and end of the beach. Lots of ships coming and going to view.
Joao makes every effort to make hosts comfortable and is very available for enquiries. We felt we were treated royally. 
The apartment is well equipped for self catering and a well stocked larder.  Joao made some very good local restaurant (many in close proximity ) recommendations too. Major Supermarket other end of beach so handy to have bikes as transport. 
Everything made available from washing machine to bedding. Massive walk in wardrobe. Hot water reliable. 
His knowledge of Porto and provision of maps and information including travel cards was very helpful. There is a bus stop very close which takes you into the city in about 40 minutes for only \u20AC1.85. Matosinhos is a 20 minute walk away where you can pick up Metro, visit a market or eat at the many fish restaurants (fresh from fish market adjacent).
We made good use of the bikes and this saved us time and expense also.
We took the brilliant cycle way (no hills!) along the coast for about 20 km (Vila do Conde and beyond). Beaches and cafes all the way so a great escape for the day.
Unfortunate the lift not always working but we survived and our fitness improved. 
Probably true of all apartments of any height, you do get some road noise and barking/ howling from local dogs.
Happy to return to what became home away from home for nearly 2 weeks.
Thankyou Joao for making it possible.

I am really happy I stayed here. The pollution from the cars in downtown Porto is intense. Jo\xE3o's place has clean air. 

There is a nice bike path that goes to the downtown and Jo\xE3o has two bikes for guest use. 

There is a large fish market a few blocks away that also has vegi's. There is a wonderful sushi bar downstairs from the apartment. 

Jo\xE3o's place is well situated, with easy access without traffic. This is a huge plus! The downtown can get gridlock. 

Jo\xE3o is a friendly, helpful host. 

I hope you enjoy your stay.

You will need about 30-40 minutes to go to the centre of Istambul by bus, keep it in mind when you plan your trip.
But though it is a bit far from the centre, there are advantages too. The house is situated in the district for locals, not for tourists. So you can buy cheap food there. You can find locum for 6 lira/kilo, cheap nuts and other turkish delights. There are also local shops near the house with good quality cotton clothes, underwear, tights etc.

We would recommend renting a car so that you can drive around the island.  Very few sights would be easily accessible to you otherwise.  There are also a full bathroom for each bedroom, so you have a 2-bedroom, 2-bath apartment.  The master bedroom has a lanai the provides a good view of the island.  The second bedroom's window looks out into the dark hallway of the apartment floor though.  A free parking spot was provided for the unit, which was convenient for our rental car.  There is also a balcony off of the kitchen that provides you with a great view of the water.\r

Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this unit!`},{at:"2016-09-22T04:00:00.000Z",by:{_id:"622f3403e36c59e6164fb006",fullname:"Tiffany",imgUrl:"https://robohash.org/2203659?set=set1",id:"2203659"},txt:"The listing is in a great location with an incredible pool and great place to watch the sunset.

The place is very clean, has a bunch of amenities, and also has some beach accessories. We came as a couple but we able to make a couple breakfast meals and just relax instead of always having to go to a restaurant. It is about 45 minutes from the airport but is only 20 minutes from the main town of Lahaina (which is great to walk around, shop, and eat) and 10 minutes from kanapali which has a lot of great restaurants and shopping.

Great location as it was within walking distance to many sights such as the Rocks, Opera House, Harbor Bridge, Darling Harbor, and George Street (shopping district). It was also conveniently located near the train station if I needed to head someplace far and to the ferries (that I took to Taronga Zoo and Manly Beach).\r

Tienes la opci\xF3n de quedarte en un cuarto privado compartiendo ba\xF1o como hice yo, o compartir cuarto o tener un cuarto con ba\xF1o. Cualquiera de las opciones funciona muy bien.\r

It's a small studio unit in a neighborhood/apartment complex like area. There is a washer dryer on property. It costs $1 to wash and about $1 to dry clothes. \r
\r
The kitchen is stocked with pots, pans, and dishes. The fridge worked great. A short drive away from Napili Plaza that has a grocery store, coffee shop, a good taco place, and a pharmacy. Also there is a shop there that has snorkel gear for rent. You will need this to swim with the sea turtles. \r
\r
The unit does not have air conditioning. I kept the sliding glass door open while I slept to keep the air circulating. Also the front door has a gate that you can lock while keeping the front door open. However some moths and the ocassional mosquito can get in. There is a screen on the sliding glass door in the back and a privacy shade that you can pull down. \r
\r
You can walk to the Napili bay beach from the condo, about 10 mins, it's better than trying to find parking. There is a weird beeping noise right outside the bathroom window. You can hear it very clearly from the bed at night. This was distracting sometimes as I am a writer so it was hard to focus. I did most of my writing at the coffee shop which as described does have Wi-Fi and is very good. \r
\r
There are two beach towels in the closet and a mini cooler for the beach. The condo unit is small, so there is no living space to hang out. But most of your day you will be out and about or at the beach all day. So you really only need this place for some cooking and sleeping. \r
\r
I did not use the TV. I turned it on once and couldn't figure out the cable so I didn't bother with it. The host is very helpful, just text if you need anything. \r
\r
There is a specific parking spot. Use the parking decal provided and stay in that spot. The trash is located at the entrance to the property. I did not check out the pool area as the beach was amazing and took up all my time. Also 5 mins away from Spa Montage. If you get a day pass for $55 you can hang out at the spa all day between the pool, hot tubs, and hydrocircuit.  It was a fun way for me to kill half a day and read in the relaxation lounge. \r
\r
From Lahaina harbor you can get day trips on a ferry over to lanai or Molokai islands as well. I heard the snorkeling at Kaanapali was a little clearer, but I noticed the currents were much stronger there. I prefer Napili bay. Give the shower pull thing a jiggle if it doesn't make the water go all the way up.`},{at:"2016-10-31T04:00:00.000Z",by:{_id:"622f3403e36c59e6164fb11e",fullname:"Carolyn",imgUrl:"https://robohash.org/69995198?set=set1",id:"69995198"},txt:"Clean, quiet, comfortable!!!"},{at:"2016-12-14T05:00:00.000Z",by:{_id:"622f3404e36c59e6164fb311",fullname:"Ed",imgUrl:"https://robohash.org/101255711?set=set1",id:"101255711"},txt:"Debra's place is very clean, quiet, comfy, and easy to get were ever you want to go.

It includes all the amenities you will need -- fast wifi, cable TV, full kitchen. It did take a couple of days to get used to living with no AC but there was always a nice breeze coming through the screen doors.  

Our favorite beach on the island was Napili Bay Beach, which is only a few minutes from the unit. Parking is available along the lower road if you get down there early enough. Kaanapali and Lahaina are only a short drive south. 

Debra was very hospitable and super responsive to any questions we had. She was also very accommodating with our early check in and late check out requests. I would not hesitate to recommend this unit and area to anyone. 

Thanks Debra!`},{at:"2017-05-08T04:00:00.000Z",by:{_id:"622f3407e36c59e6164fbd5f",fullname:"Eva",imgUrl:"https://robohash.org/47621?set=set1",id:"47621"},txt:`Debra's apartment was exactly what I needed. I had booked other accommodation but had a creepy incident that caused me to leave abruptly. I was able to message and confirm booking with Debra all within an hour on a Saturday night which is amazing. THANK YOU DEBRA! 

The apartment was very clean and had good add-ons for going to the beach (cooler, beach towels, snorkel mask). 

My major feedback:

1. The apartment gets hot at night unless you're comfortable sleeping with the sliding door glass open. Coming from my creepy situation, I did not feel comfortable sleeping with it open and there are not other windows in the sleeping/common area. Debra mentions something along these lines in her posting so take that seriously. 

2. You can hear your neighbors. One neighbor was up at 5am and it sounded like they were literally on my patio. The other neighbor upstairs had a young baby that I heard crying. The apartment is also under the stairs so you can hear people walking up/down the stairs when it's extra quiet at night. I'll admit that I was a little harder to please than usual -- I was more jumpy to noises since my space had been violated at the other accommodation. Also, you're in Maui. If you're up at 5am it's not the worst thing in the world. 

3) I paid $200/night total w/ fees and it felt slightly overpriced. Small things that made me feel that way -- no dish towels (I think?),  a rusty shower head + dingy shower curtain, no place to leave wet things (you're warned that you'll be fined if you leave clutter or beach gear on the patio or walk way) All that said, perspective! We're in Maui and $200 night was some of the cheapest accommodation I could find. It's all relative. 

Overall, the place was safe, clean, and convent to driving Route 30 south/north to the other towns beyond Napili. There's a grocery store and some great happy hours nearby. Really grateful I had a roof over my head, a comfy bed to collapse into and a door that locked. Thank you Debra. `}],_id:"622f337c75c7d36e498aabe5",imgUrls:["086.jpeg","028.jpeg","139.jpeg","115.jpeg","004.jpeg"]},{name:"Charming urban 1 Bedroom apartment",summary:"Our cute and comfortable one bedroom apartment has an actual urban city feel.Located in the Trendy area of Sai Ying Pun, where markets stalls and mechanic shops blend with hipster bars and restaurants.

First, the location was incredible.  Literally overlooking the Tamarama beach and a beautifull balcany to sit on and watch the world go by.  \r
Secondly, the apartment itself was perfect.  It is clean, with great entertaining spaces and very welcoming.  You don't feel like your invading another persons home but it still feels homely - if that makes sense!  The beds, couch and linen were all clean, fresh and comfortable.\r
Third, it's only a 10 min walk to Bondi!\r
Finally, Wayne is lovely and immediately responded to all my questions.  We only booked the apartment a few days before, and it was my first time dealing with airbnb, so we really appreciated the quick responses.  Also, we had a bottle of champagne and chocolates on arrival which was a lovely surprise!\r
I would highly recommend this apartment.  It is the perfect place for people who want to hang out, relax and and enjoy one of Sydney's premier beach locations.  \r

The short walk to different subways meant getting into the city was very fast, particularly areas such as East Village and Park Slope.  We regularly went from the heart of the city back to the apartment within 20-30 minutes, a good escape when the crowds got too much in  Manhattan.\r

However, seeing as most of us were out (not home) doing activities during the hot days, the nights were cool enough to open the windows, and Zoe provided a few fans, so it was manageable. Other than that, I highly recommend this place. Clean, comfortable, modernized, close to bus stops and subways, bike rental access across the street, not too far from downtown, and lots of restaurants and cafes in the area."},{at:"2018-07-01T04:00:00.000Z",by:{_id:"622f3403e36c59e6164fb222",fullname:"Maki",imgUrl:"https://robohash.org/189920210?set=set1",id:"189920210"},txt:"Simplement parfait!

Really nice linens on the beds, plenty of towels, good lighting. Amazing main bathroom shower-we took pictures of it! 
Great closet space, again with coat hangers. Off of the main bedroom, there is an away space-office type room. My husband used it to meditate, but it'd be great for any kind of quiet space. We didn't use the courtyard, but it would be so nice to utilize in milder weather. 
We didn't see Miriam, but she was very good at communicating by email.

It is close to everything including the Siqueira Campos Metro stop which is a big plus if you need to get to downtown Rio. There are parts of Copacabana that are quite a trek from the Metro. There are all sorts of restaurants within a block in all directions and of course the beach a 5-minute walk away.\r
\r
Everything is brand new and the apartment feels modern and cozy at the same time. It is however quite small. I was there by myself for 4 nights and it was perfect. Great for a couple as well if you get along really well. I wouldn't try to put 3 people in this place. When the bed is unfolded there is very little floor space left. The little space there is actually feels a lot bigger because it is very organized. It is easy to keep tidy since there is really only one place to put each thing. The handy apartment guide shows you where things go, how to unfold the sofa into the various configurations, and has some tips on the area. \r
\r
There is both wired and wireless Internet which was fast and worked perfectly for me. There is a nice little flat screen TV with satellite channels and easily accessible hdmi ports so you can hook up your laptop and play your own content. Sometimes wall-mounted flat screens make it really hard to get to the hdmi ports, but not in this case.\r
\r
Note that power outlets in Brazil come in about 4 different flavours and you can never really be sure whether it is 110V or 220V. So bring adapters and make sure anything you plug in won't be fried by being plugged into a 220V outlet. In this apartment all (and there are surprisingly many) the outlets are IEC-906-1 type plugs at 220V. It is 3-pronged but still 2-prong Europlug compatible so if you are coming from most of Europe you won't need adapters. If you are coming from North America, bring some regular US-Euro adapters.\r
\r
The view of Cristo Redentor (Christ the Redeemer statue) is especially nice at sunset and in the evening when it is lit up. There is a shot of it at sunset taken from the window of the apartment here: (Website hidden by Airbnb) \r

Alan and Catherine's studio is a beautiful place to stay. The creative design and artistic details are inspiringly put together. It is also wonderful because it is situated in the heart of Copa. Very close to the shops, the beach, the metro, and major tourist attractions. Location and design are the perfect combo to make your stay comfortable and rewarding!\r
\r
Alan is such a kind, polite and thoughtful person! I will not forget his kindness. He went above and beyond to make my stay a happy one. In fact, he went well and beyond my expectations of a land lord. He even helped me organise a taxi to leave and booked it for me. Alan also arranged to get the apartment cleaned mid-stay. I did not ask him to do this. In sum, you could not want nicer person to deal with! Alan is a rare gem! He responds to emails in a timely manner and is a generous, helpful and wonderful!  He thinks of everything to make your stay a happy one!\r
\r
The apartment building is nice and the couple that work at the door and look after the cleaning are such warm, kind and beautiful Brazilian people!!! They helped me so much with many things. When I arrived my luggage was missing, so they rang the airport and even offered to drive me to the airport! They even helped me go shopping for electrical goods so I could use my computer. Outstanding kindness!!!  It was a joy to come and home and say hello to them on the way to the elevator. I will miss them very much!\r
\r
The apartment is comfortable because every last detail has been very well considered. Coming from Australia, I found the internet speed very fast and easy to connect. The cable TV is excellent and nice to watch after a long day touring Rio! The kitchen is perfect and is a delightful place to make yummy breakfast etc. The bathroom is very well designed. While the living room and bedroom is a joy to be in due to the artwork and beautiful use of form and light. The use of colour in the studio is visually sophisticated and joyful. I really loved the use of design to create atmosphere and mixed with Brazilian art, this is a real treat to enjoy! Loved it!!!\r
\r
I really enjoyed dealing with Alan and Catherine. They are perfect hosts and I will be coming back to stay again for sure! Thank you so much Alan and Catherine for letting me stay in your beautiful home. I had the best time and will always remember how lovely your home and your wonderful kindness! \r

I am a newcomer to this fantastic forum and had no recommendations or much detail in my profile while the apartment that Alan and Catherine entrusted me with truly is their home in Rio. It is a lovely designed little gem in Copa. It is amazing to see how much thought this couple spent in developing this small apartment into a little home where everything just fits perfectly. \r
\r
The apartment is light during day and the sofa transforms into a most comfortable bed at night. When I read the description of the apartment I initially had my doubts about the sleeper coach but chose this apartment as all other things just sounded perfect. Well, it turned out that the sleeper couch is as perfect as the apartment proved to be. The most comfortable sleeper I have ever experienced!\r
\r
The apartment was recently totally renovated and is kept in such good shape that it still feels new. One of the apartment's big asset (apart from its beautiful furniture and interior) is the large shower! And of course the aircon for the hot Rio summer nights!\r
\r
The apartment is nearby a vast range of fair, good and excellent restaurants and various supermarkets and shops.\r
\r
The special treat is the welcome pack which allows you some time to study the wonderful recommendations and tips Allan and Catherine provide you with in a little info brochure to assist you in finding your own way in the surrounding area. Alan also offed a Kyle chat to assist me finding my way, but I found the info provided so detailed that this was not necessary.\r
\r
As with most apartments in Rio, security is tops with a watchfull 24/7 door guard, who by the way is always keen to help where he can.\r
\r
The Wifi is pleasantly fast and reliable! \r
\r
I can only recommend Alan's and Catherine's home in Rio. It is stable for short term, for long term, for business or for just visiting Copa (which, if i may stray off the point :) ) should be on everyones list of things to do while you still can!!!!!)\r
\r
Thank Alan, thanks Catherine! Your apartment and I will meet gain :) !\r

Catherine and Alan are excellent hosts, have provided lots of useful information about their local area and its haunts, and have been prompt in all their dealings through Airbnb.\r

\r
Alan and Catherine were absolutely exceptional hosts who went above and beyond their responsibilities as hosts and we could not recommend them more highly. They were extremely fast in responding to our quires and we had a good few especially as it was over carnival (They even responded to out quires during our week in the apartment and helped us with a problem we were having booking flights to Iguazu falls). The studio is ideally situated in a very safe area (although we found nearly everywhere in Rio to be very safe) that is perfect for exploring Copacabana and the surrounding areas. The city itself can be somewhat overwhelming at first but Alan and Catherine\u2019s starter and information packs gave us the confidence to venture all over they city without hesitation. Carnival is an amazing time to go and it is good to have somewhere private to go back to after a long day or night at a bloc party (which you will run into everywhere). As a first time couple using this site we could not have been more happy with the outcome and it really made our trip to Rio carnival one we will never forget. So all that\u2019s left to say is go and in stay in Alan and Catherine\u2019s beautiful apartment, don\u2019t believe the negative things you hear about Rio and bring a wig or a hat for carnival as you wont see a local without one :)`},{at:"2012-03-22T04:00:00.000Z",by:{_id:"622f3402e36c59e6164fac16",fullname:"Tom And Cecilia",imgUrl:"https://robohash.org/1376452?set=set1",id:"1376452"},txt:`Our experience with Alan and Catherine's apartment in Rio was a dream experience.  Our first time in Rio, we were faced with a 1:00 AM arrival at GIG.   Already wary of what I had read about airport taxi, I wondered how we were going to deal with this one.  No problem, everything was promptly arranged with their trusted driver who was at the airport promptly with our name and a reaonsable cost. \r
\r
The apartment is on a beautiful quaint street in the heart of Copacabana.  Building security is fantastic with trusted 24 hr porters,  restricted access to the floors.  We felt much safer than in a hotel -- but Rio  not to be construed as an unsafe city.  We felt fine everywhere we went.  The metro is clean and efficient.  \r
\r
Everything in the apartment is well organized and works.  The high speed internet permitted flawless (Hidden by Airbnb) calls at all hours - a great stress reliever when you're on business.\r
\r
Alan and Catherine responded immediately to al communications, offered tons of helpful information about the area, checked in frequently to see if anything needed.  Its just goes on and on.  In short, they "get it".   Its not about the apartment, rather the total experience. \r

Put this on your A list and consider yourself lucky if it books..\r

The studio is great! It is very well designed. Everything works perfectly well and Internet is faster than what we have in Switzerland! The location is great too! About 5 minutes walk to the beach of Copacabana, and located in a safe neighborhood. The bus station to go to the Sugar Loaf is about 10 minutes walk and the subway and the supermarket are only 3 minutes walking distance. Ipanema is only a 30 minute walk or you can take the subway (2 stations). Catherine and Alan were very helpful in helping us organize our trip. They were very patient with all our questions and fast in responding emails. They also helped us book our transportation to the apartment and all went very smoothly. We also loved the handbook loaded with all sorts of recommendations. We tried out a few restaurants and were not disappointed. We also went to Churrascaria Carretao (10 minutes walk) as my husband loves grilled meat (very touristy, get there early to avoid the tourist buses!). The hotel Othon has a restaurant on the top floor with a beautiful view of the beach of Copacabana. The food is rather pricey but the view is definitely worth it! The restaurant Colombo in the Fort of Copacabana is supposed to be good too, unfortunately we ran out of time! There are some very nice markets on Sundays. When heading to the hippie market in Ipanema stop at this very small market off Avenida Atlantica just before the Fort of Capacabana! They sell great pastels and the best caldos de cane! There is also an information center on Copacabana only a few minutes  towards Leme... And all this in short walking distance from the studio! \r

The apartment itself is exactly as advertised. Comfortable, well equipped with all the essential kitchen appliances and accessories. Air conditioning in the main living room, and portable air conditioning in the bedroom which worked a treat during our stay. The added extras such as beach chairs, beach mats and a drinks/food cooler was very much appreciated, and used every day. Parking is right at the front and easy to access. 

The location is to die for. Having explored every part of this amazing Island we agreed that our favourite location was Kikei. The locals were very friendly, access to restaurants and supermarkets was just minutes away, and many of the Island learn to surf clinics (highly recommend doing this!) were run from a beach 5 minutes walk along the street. Every day we swam with turtles at the beaches immediately in the area of the apartment. You can literally walk out of the apartment, across the road and watch the sunset over the ocean every day.

The room was small but cosy and clean. Shampoo, shower gel and toothbrush with toothpaste are provided. Towels are available on request. \r
The location is right in the middle of Nathan Road. You can choose to walk to either Mongkok and Ya Mau Tei MTR and both are just a 5-7 mins walk away.\r
Overall, a good convenient place to stay for short trips.`},{at:"2015-01-05T05:00:00.000Z",by:{_id:"622f3407e36c59e6164fc060",fullname:"Allie",imgUrl:"https://robohash.org/24848390?set=set1",id:"24848390"},txt:"We knew our 3 nights stay got off to good start with warm welcome from Mr Yiu :) Very near to Mong Kok MRT station which is made it very convenient for us to explore Hong Kong.

The room did look like from the pictures- the beds came in single twin beds, and even the comforter sets, the bedsheets were exactly like in the picture too! (even the curtains). \r
\r
I've to commend the room's cleanliness. One of the first few things that I noticed about the room when I stepped in was its clean floor- spick and span, I did not spot clumps of hair or the floor being covered in dust- that was one of the strengths of the room. \r
\r
Secondly, the toilet's floor was clean and there was no hair lying about the floor, or murky stains spotted about the toilet (not that I dared inspect every corner dilligently- but I stepped into the toilet barefooted, assured that it was clean)\r
\r
They only provide basic body foam and shampoo, which are put into wall dispensers. I found the body soap to suffice but the shampoo was abit drying and so you might want to bring your own shampoo perhaps. \r
\r
Cleanliness-wise, I give the sleeping area room + the toilets a 3.5 / 5 stars as I did not spot any dirt that irked me, the floors were clean enough to walk barefoot and they looked without dust. \r
Perhaps, the only area which I did not walk barefoot much on was the doorway area as we were wearing shoes in and walking on it, during our first day. \r
\r
Space-wise, it may be small, but mangeable for 2 people. I would say that it is just nice- roomy for 1 pax but just nice- slightly tight (depending on how spacey a room you are used to) for 2 people. Hong Kong is known for small room sizes though, so I thought this small room space is common.\r
The toilet is quite small though, and the places to hang your clothes/towels might not be as luxurious as hotels but we managed alright ultimately. There's not much space to move in the toilet. But its cleanliness and the reasonable price topped the space constraints! Bedroom wise , space is alright for 2 people.\r
\r
Perhaps, the room window was the only difficult thing managing as it was abit hard closing it and some slight dust.\r
\r
Towels and linen smelt fresh! Bedsheets felt clean!\r
You need to request for towels. \r
Host was very obliging, VERY, in answering all my many questions! I emailed her TONS. \r
Keith & Joey were on duty when we were there and both are helpful, obliging people. Joey was very friendly and helped us to check which Karaoke places were cheap and the night bus to the airport! Their guesthouse is quite systematic I feel, with either Keith or Joey(lu xiao jie) on duty at different times of the day and they give you the number to call them with a phone hung outside the reception door. \r
Keith answered any questions we had too! \r
They even provided us a SIM card with internet!\r
THANK YOU Athena, Keith&Joey! \r
For this price&cleanliness, it's worth.\r

Really enjoyed the neighborhood - it was fairly quiet at night, but just a few blocks to walk to the shops and restaurants along Hollywood Road (the art/artisan shops at PMQ were our favorite). The kitchen is well equipped and there are two grocery markets within a few minutes walk (one Chinese-style and one English-style), so it was easy to make breakfast each morning, open up the balcony doors, and listen to the birds chirping in the park across the street. Barbara was very helpful with suggestions on dinner places - she gave us 6 suggestions within a 5 minute walk; we made it to 5 and had a great meal each time.

It took some adjusting for us to hang out in the area.  The area is considered 'gritty' which is extremely true. I cant stress that enough. It is dirty, you might be bothered for spare change, you might be asked to swipe your metro card for someone,  however the area does have some of the coolest restaurants in the city. But you must go looking for them, otherwise you will only find corner deli's that don't take international credit cards and random pawn shops etc.  We actually loved our experience at Shannon's though. Shannon's studio was great. Lots of space for two. The only complaints we had were that the walls were paper thin and it was all around a bit dirty. We washed the dishes before using them since they were dusty and just kept a fan at night to block out noise. We also could not reach Shannon until the day of our reservation and had to wait past check in time to get the keys. Once we were in contact, Shannon was super nice and helpful. The roof top is amazing! You can see some of Manhatten's skyline. The subway takes about half an hour to get to Manhatten , once you are there, probably another 15 to wherever you want to go. It is nice to get away from the zoo of Manhatten, I strongly recommend staying in Brooklyn, it's gives you more of a well rounded experience.  For us, this was great, we loved the experience of what it would be like to live there."},{at:"2015-12-23T05:00:00.000Z",by:{_id:"622f3402e36c59e6164fad02",fullname:"Jessica",imgUrl:"https://robohash.org/13613061?set=set1",id:"13613061"},txt:"Shannon's apartment was fantastic.

The spatial arrangement of the house, which I speculate would have been built in the 50s or 60s, is great: two bedrooms are in the first floor, luminous but protected from direct exposure to sunlight, excellent for peaceful sleep. A spacious and nicely decorated living room upstairs boasts a commanding view of the garden, the sea, and the neighboring island (Heybeliada). The living room connects to a kitchen and a balcony overlooking the garden where we enjoyed our meals. The garden was my favorite spot. It is not for those who love neatly arranged, engineered, and regularly maintained gardens. Sanem\xB4s is an essentially picturesque garden with wild plants that look like being there for ages. There are regularized pockets where Sanem has planted tomatoes, cucumbers, and green peppers. I loved watering them. She graciously let us taste mulberries and plums. Four different plum trees, two different mulberry trees, a cherry tree, a sour cherry tree, fig tree, vines, roses, loquat, and of course the sublime pine tree partly covered by a delightful bougainvillea... Yes, this is still considered to be Istanbul. The notorious phaeton noises and manure smells of B\xFCy\xFCkada stay away from this house. We only smelt flowers and post-rain soil, and heard beautiful seagulls whose concert sabotaged occasionally by gangs of crows plotting to take plums and mulberries away... Despite all its peacefulness, the house is not completely isolated: there are two small groceries and a restaurant just about fifty meters down the street. Sanem is a lovely person. She met us at the check-in, made sure we had a pleasant stay, and encouraged us to contact her anytime should there be any inconvenience, which never happened. Great house, dream garden.

1) Frequent water shortage. Something which Chronis did not mention beforehand. When we brought to his attention, he says that "this is a usual Istanbul problem. It's not my house problem". A great way to wash his hands off the situation in my opinion. 
2) Cancellation and refunds will not be entertained. Initially, we wanted to change the dates but his appartment was not available on those dates. We had asked if we could get a refund since it's not available but he did not respond. So we went with the initial dates. Second time we asked for a refund was after the water shortage incident. We didn't stay throughout, and had 6 nights remaining. Once again we asked for a refund but he did not respond.

Is good communication to your host and a warm welcome important to you? Ever wanted to stay in an amazingly designed, old Istanbul-apartment? Then you found your location to stay! My friend and I, both of turkish decent, stayed in this apartment for a week during March (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) Two days before our flight to Istanbuk, Chronis contacted us and gave us thorough information on address and what we should be careful about, like not being too loud with music for the sake of the neighbors. Furthermore he told us, that his assistant Ms. Margarita will welcome us at our arrival, since he was not in Istanbul during that time. He gave us Ms. Margaritas and his phonenumer to contact them upon arrival via phone or (Hidden by Airbnb) Messenger. After our arrival we contacted Ms. Margarita on (Hidden by Airbnb) and told her our approximate time of arrival in front of the apartment. She responded quickly. Upon arrival at the apartment we rang the bell of the flat, which Chronis told us in before and were quickly welcomed by Ms. Margarita. She gave us a very friendly and warm welcome and informed us on everything important about the flat. She had only prepared one bed in the big bedroom, since she assumed we'd be a couple. After having told her, that we need two seperate beds, the quickly prepared the second bed in the small bedroom, without any hesitation. Furthermore she informed us about possible issues like water failures, which is normal in Istanbul during this season, because of heavy rains and a bad water infrastructure. She even prepared water canisters in case, so that we could still finish the shower or use the toilet. Because it was already very late when we arrived, we agreed on asking further questions via phone or (Hidden by Airbnb) . The following days, she wrote us on (Hidden by Airbnb) to check if everything's ok. During our stay we made mostly good experiences with the flat. The most mentionable ones are the following: 1) The bed in the big bedroom is very comfy. 2) There are lots of fresh towels and duvet covers in case that you like to change very frequently. 3) The kitchen is equipped with everything needed for a decent meal. The stove is new and there is a dishwasher, if you like to use one. 4) The view from the living room is AMAZING! I doubt, you can find many other apartments with such a nice view in central Istanbul. 5) The water actually never failed ;) There were also some SMALLER points, which could improve. The most important ones: 1) The bed in the smaller bedroom is directy next to the radiator, which can make sleeping there during the cold season very hot. If you shut off the heating, the floor and flat itself can get quite cold, since it's an old building with wood battens. 2)...`},{at:"2018-04-13T04:00:00.000Z",by:{_id:"622f3406e36c59e6164fbc20",fullname:"Laura",imgUrl:"https://robohash.org/23592840?set=set1",id:"23592840"},txt:`Very nice apartment.

The stay is overall very comfortable and I would stay there again. Having said that, there were a few things to note for improvement, but not deal breakers for me: \r
\r
1. we stayed a week and ran out of toilet paper on day 3. we were informed that we need to supply our toilet paper. not an expensive buy, but the inconvenience of having to worry about that was not pleasant.\r
2. the smell of cigarette smoking from other apartments in the building kept coming in through the heating vents, i had to open the windows to air the rooms every few hours. This was certainly unpleasant, but i guess it could happen anywhere.\r
3. as others mentioned, sometimes smells were noticed in the bathrooms - it happened randomly through the day. i guess the building;s vent systems are not great.\r

\r
Oporto Rental Management was created in 2015 by the wishes of four young friends: Rosa, Tania, Igor and Nuno. The ORM was born of the combination of the main passions of its founders: the city of Porto and its cultural characteristics; the architecture and decoration; the gastronomy and photography and, above all, the contact with different cultures.\r
\r
The project is based on the support and guidance of property owners located in the center of the city who want to direct their homes to the tourism market.\r
\r
It also involves the design and decoration of these same spaces, giving them a unique identity that translates into the extremely positive reaction of our guests.\r
Our project culminates in the total management of the property, which includes the organization and preparation of these spaces for the tourist rental.\r
So with our dedication and daily work we have been able to please our guests who show the highest intention of repeating their experiences with our team. \r
In addition, besides the management, we are responsible for the constant guests' contact and that we privelege the personalized accompaniment - what distinguishes us and allows us a greater proximity to the diverse cultures.\r

\r
Quatro amigos, muitos sonhos, um caminho em comum\r
\r
Oporto Rental Management surgiu em 2015 pela vontade de quatro jovens amigos: a Rosa, a T\xE2nia, o Igor e o Nuno. A ORM nasce da combina\xE7\xE3o das principais paix\xF5es dos seus fundadores: a cidade do Porto e as suas caracter\xEDsticas culturais; a arquitetura e decora\xE7\xE3o; a gastronomia e fotografia e, acima de tudo, o contacto com diversas culturas. \r
\r
O projeto baseia-se no apoio e orienta\xE7\xE3o de propriet\xE1rios de im\xF3veis localizados no centro da cidade que pretendam direcionar as suas casas para o mercado do turismo.\r
Envolve ainda a conce\xE7\xE3o e decora\xE7\xE3o destes mesmos espa\xE7os, conferindo-lhes desta forma, uma identidade \xFAnica que se traduz na rea\xE7\xE3o extremamente positiva dos nossos h\xF3spedes. \r
O nosso projeto culmina na gest\xE3o total do im\xF3vel, que inclui a organiza\xE7\xE3o e a prepara\xE7\xE3o destes espa\xE7os para o arrendamento tur\xEDstico. \r
Assim, com a nossa dedica\xE7\xE3o e trabalho di\xE1rios temos vindo a conseguir conquistar todos quantos nos visitam e que demonstram a maior inten\xE7\xE3o de repetir as suas experi\xEAncias com a nossa equipa. \r
Acrescentamos ainda que al\xE9m da gest\xE3o somos respons\xE1veis pelo contacto constante com os nossos h\xF3spedes e que prezamos o acompanhamento personalizado - o que nos distingue e nos permite uma maior proximidade com as diversas culturas.\r

Firstly the room was amazing. It was the basement of their home with a lot of space and a half bathroom. Really relaxing experience with all the privacy you want, a large TV with Netflix and Amazon  for those who like to watch a nice movie when coming back from a long day in New York. The photos on airbnb are not really capturing how nicely decorated and well kept is the room. Nothing compared to other rooms I have seen in Astoria. The towels provided are of very good quality and very large, the wi-fi works perfectly and there is plenty of space for your things. To me and after seeing a lot of rooms, there is no doubt that this one is the best taking into consideration the space provided, the location and the price asked!\r
The neighborhood was again really pretty. Very safe with lots of shops for food and interesting markets. I had the feeling and really wanted to go back to Astoria and walk around after a busy day in Manhattan. 4min walk to 30th station and 16 min ride to Lex avenue and the upper east side which in my opinion is the best area in NY \r
I can't say enough about Gabe and his mum. Their hospitality was awesome! I was welcomed with a lot of snacks, fruits and a bottle of wine waiting for me when I arrived and kept coming during my stay. Gabe was answering immediately to all my texts and tried to sort out anything I needed in order to feel more at home! But besides that the most important thing is that both of them are very interesting and well educated people. You can have a lot of discussions about lots of things and learn, which at least for me is very important! I think I made some friends in NYC, which by the way is a truly amazing city.\r
Highly recommended, no need to look anywhere else! Thanks a lot guys.`},{at:"2016-04-30T04:00:00.000Z",by:{_id:"622f3405e36c59e6164fb6a6",fullname:"Kirk",imgUrl:"https://robohash.org/3561642?set=set1",id:"3561642"},txt:`Staying at Gabe's apartment was a domestic Experience with a capital E.\r
\r
Gabe met me when I arrived and showed me the place. He had answers to my questions about the area and was good company while I settled in, great guy.\r
\r
His guest floor includes a private entrance and bath, custom furniture laid out to fit the space, and enough artwork to befit a museum.\r
\r
Let me count the ways I loved this place:\r
1) Laid out and available were snacks, coffee machine + spindle of flavor cups, water, and a toothbrush.\r
2) The place has style. I keep a good home but Gabe clearly has a future career as interior decorator awaiting him.\r
3) Plants! There's a garden of greenery spread around the apt.\r
4) Everything useful is labeled, from the lightswitches to the recycling bin.\r
5) There is a pre-sentient voice-activated music player in the living room. "Alexa play some Jazz". "Alexa louder". "Alexa next". I'll be getting one of these for myself, it's from Amazon apparently.\r
\r
Hosts like Gabe make Airbnb amazing to use. I hope all my future hosts will be similarly excellent.\r

The bed was super comfortable, the room was really beautiful, and the apartment was extremely nice. Gabe and his mother were very friendly, (we had the place to ourselves)  which was perfect although we were out wandering the city all day,  when we did see them upon arrival they were helpful, sweet, & very welcoming! The area is perfect, very close to the train, shops, caf\xE9s and some of the best food on this trip. Super nice block - nothing to worry about with a private entrance, that allows you to come and go freely. It was such a nice spot! The pictures do not give you what the experience will - it was great not having to NOT worry about anything.  \r
\r
Gabe provided towels, toiletries, iron, Tylenol any and everything you may need on a trip (that you sometimes forget to pack). Thanks Gabe!\r

I totally recommend staying here, whether for a day or a month.

Probably one of the best Airbnb options in Astoria and definitely way better (in terms of value for money) than any hotel, especially if you are staying for more than a few days.  \r

Brilliant safe location - just off the busy Balik market and Istiklal Caddesi so it was quiet at night but just a step away from the hectic excitement of the street-life, and only a 5 minute walk from the Taksim or Sishane  metro stops, making to very accessible for exploring the rest of Istanbul.
Our room (22) was great - perfectly clean and tidy with some beautiful touches and the most amazing, powerful and hot, if uniquely shaped, shower.
The friendliness and recommendations from our hosts were spot-on and added to the incredible experience that is Istanbul. Definitely recommended.

It was also our first time using Airbnb and visiting a Hawaiian Island and we would definitely do it all over again. Early in our planning we intentionally made the decision to avoid the big resorts and seek out something that felt a little more like the "real" Hawaii. Eve's rustic cabin provided just that. The cabin was clean and comfy, with a great amount of lighting and windows. One of my favorite parts of the cabin was the large window high above the kitchen that looks into the jungle across the stream. It almost looks like a framed painting every morning when you wakeup.  The chirping birds in the jungle made it that much better. The property is close to Makawao and Pa'ia, both of which have great dinning and shopping and a great small town feel. We still visited the big resort towns for the beaches which weren't too far away. A baby beach protected by a reef is also just 10 min away! We found the cabin to be a great central location to see just about everything on the island. 

Tip: We bought the book "Maui Revealed" before we made this trip and used it religiously the entire time we were there. Kula Bistro is a must, Makawao fresh morning doughnuts in the white building with green trim and usually a line (it's quick I promise!) 808 Cafe has great food and is across the street from our favorite beaches. Drive to Hana takes all day if you go all the way around, but is so very worth it. Get out and see everything! Bring food!
The Gingerbread Cottage is a perfect central location to everything on the island, but far enough from the hustle of the towns. Be sure to do the labyrinth walks on the property, it's a great way to prepare your mind to enjoy your vacation, also go sit by the river and read a bit, it's very relaxing. We will be back next year!!!`},{at:"2014-07-01T04:00:00.000Z",by:{_id:"622f3405e36c59e6164fb678",fullname:"Heidimarie",imgUrl:"https://robohash.org/6930819?set=set1",id:"6930819"},txt:"Steve met me when I arrived.

I stayed in apartment 2 which was on the first floor. You get a lot for you money, big apartment with tall ceilings, very tastefully (and newly) decorated and with a huge terrace which was nice but I hardly used it as I was out so much. 

The host was very friendly and communicative. In terms of location it's within a stone's throw from the main shopping and nightlife of Taksim but enough out the way that it won't disturb your sleep. Restaurants, cash machines etc are all less than a five minute walk. It's barely a minute from the main road so you're not walking deep into a potentially dodgy neighbourhood. Do your (Hidden by Airbnb) maps homework before you get there and it's easy enough to find. 

I took the Havatas bus from Attaturk Airport which took around 50 mins and dropped me off in Taksim (Point hotel). From there it was about a 15/20 minute walk. If you come with suitcases however you'll want to get a cab as the pavements in Istanbul are not build for cases! Next time I'm in Istanbul I'll definitely be coming back here. `},{at:"2015-12-12T05:00:00.000Z",by:{_id:"622f3402e36c59e6164fad54",fullname:"Lara",imgUrl:"https://robohash.org/10264026?set=set1",id:"10264026"},txt:"This is a very quiet great place, in a great location.

Wifi is excellent. Just about everything is within walking distance and there are loads of fantastic restaurants and bars close by. If you feel the desire to self-Cater there are two brilliant fruit & veg stalls a couple of doors down and a good little supermarket. I always felt safe in the street, even at night and staying at Greystone offered a brilliant insight into local life whilst being so close to all of the attractions! And I was an Airbnb virgin too!\r

Kayanh and his family were awesome. He was great in making me feel at home, I left feeling like family. He took me on a tour of Rio on my first day and showed me everything to do in Rio. He was so accommodating and made me feel at home when I first arrived. Kayanh far exceeded my expectations. The home is so beautiful (I called it the tree house). The bedroom has everything- TV, fans, zoned air conditioning. The bathroom was awesome too. Everything was very well decorated and very clean. The neighborhood was great. It was in a very private, quiet neighborhood, close to the BRT and the area is very convenient, everything is in a walkable distance if you like walking. \r
\r
Kayanh home is 35-40 min from the airport by car and 1 hour from Centro Brazil, if you do not mind travelling by public transportation all the tourist areas are accessible.   \r

Could not recommend more highly to visit Porto and Zahia's home.

Obrigado

Jessica was a lovely host! Despite her being unwell while I stayed there I could always rely on her to help me out with anything around the flat, awesome restaurant and sightseeing recommendations and just generally pleasant company :) The cats were lovely and very affectionate. I definitely felt at home at Jessica's flat. Extremely well located for buses to take you to either Bondi or central Sydney, as it's basically halfway in between. I walked to Mrs McQuarries point one day and it took just over an hour to do so, buses take 10-15 minutes to central. Paddington itself is a cute neighbourhood with some nice places to eat/drink/shop nearby. Quite a few steps to take up to the flat just for anyone who might have issues with that, I didn't.

We initially estimated our arrival at 4PM, but ended up arriving around 3PM and only gave Hugo 30 minutes notice. Regardless he was there waiting for us and gave us a thorough explanation of the apartment, location and sites for us to visit.\r
\r
We are a family of two adults and two children. The apartment is not really optimal for small children, because of the rickety staircase. But we made due with the sleeping arrangements on the first floor and had a great time.\r
\r
The apartment is small but very nicely decorated and was exactly as described. The location is great. Just next to the Ponte Lu\xEDs I bridge and the riverside restaurants. The apartment faces away from the water but this allows for a small terrace facing toward the cliff side, which was very nice for a spot of air. \r
\r
Hugo also has a deal with a breakfast delivery service, whom left a beautiful basket outside our door. The service also catered to Hugos high service standard and replaced the coffee in our basket with chocolate milk, which was immensely more popular with our children.\r
\r
I can only give my best recommendation to both Hugo and the apartment. It is a beautiful space in a prime location at a semi affordable rate.

You can walk down Atlantic Avenue or State to get to Brooklyn Bridge Park (which is quite lovely!).  It's about a 10 minute walk.

Judy was a great host. When we arrived, we found that she had left us a carton of organic milk, granola, and a package of Stumptown coffee. She gave us some good tips for local restaurants, and she let us store our luggage in the building for a little while after we checked out. \r
\r
The location is great. There are some good restaurants just around the corner on Atlantic, as well as a very good french bakery. Just a couple of blocks down Bond are two more very good restaurants, Building on Bond and Ruccola. The neighborhood is great to walk around. Smith St. is just a couple of blocks away with tons of shops, bars, restaurants. The Hoyt Schermerhorn metro is just a couple of blocks away, which can take you into the city on the A or C, or further into Brooklyn on the G. Other statios are a few minutes walk away. \r

We've had a great stay at Judy and Sasha's place ! The apartment is spotless, actually larger than it appears on the pictures, has all you need and is very tastefully decorated. Our hosts went out of their way to accommodate our two year old son on a real mattress in the main bedroom. Although the nearby avenue can be a bit loud at night, earplugs are provided, and the cool humming of the aircon happens to cover most of it.\r
\r
The neighborhood is great ! Lively yet very safe. Within walking distance is the buzzing Fulton Mall, and the more elegant Smith St. and Court St. Plenty of restaurants, bars, bakeries and caf\xE9s. Judy and Sasha provided us with a list of their favorite places - Don't miss Van Leeuwen's unforgettable organic Ginger Ice Cream ! Catch the A and C lines at the Hoyt-Schermerhorn station, one block away, and ride to downtown Manhattan in ten minutes... \r
\r
Judy and Sasha are discreet hosts, yet very caring. We've been texting prior to our arrival and while we were staying there. They dealt with any little issue in a swift and elegant manner. We really felt like we had settled in Brooklyn for a week, and have left NYC with unforgettable memories. \r

Its a nice french restaurant close to the corner of Bond St. and Atlantic Ave. And for midnight munchies there are a few 24 hour convenience stores near by. It is also worth mentioning that the apartment is within walking distance to the bustling Fulton Mall stretch, where you can find good buys.\r

I found the Hoyt-Schermerhorn subway station to be very convenient as it was very close to the apartment. You can catch both the A and C lines which will take you in and out of Manhattan in about 10 minutes or so.\r

Judy was a joy to deal with and I thank her for her hospitality. She answered my questions swiftly and responded to a slight glitch in the internet quickly which was a great help.

The neighborhood is truly in the fashion of a Bohemian San Francisco with steep winding streets and many excellent restaurants, flea markets,and designer shops all near by.\r
The best surprise of all was the the fantastic roof patio where one can sit and see the beautiful views of the Golden Horn and the Blue Mosque in the distance.\r
The rooms are airy and light with tall ceilings, and her personally designed cabinets and interior ,had such a simple elegant feel.\r
The separate bedroom is extremely cool in the summer and relaxing ,which has a view to the back over a tree covered 400 year old Hamam .The combined call to prayer and  the sound of many birds is positively magic. \r

All the beach gear you will need, soft cooler, two beach chairs, several sets of snorkel gear, two boggie boards, umbrella and beach towels. He also has plenty of regular towels and all the shower stuff you will need. In-unit laundry with all the detergents hairdryer, first-aid kit, the list goes on.

\r
Hi!\r
\r
I've been on Airbnb since 2011 and I\u2019m a big fan of the Platform. All I got was thanks to my success on Airbnb!\r
\r
My experience began when I received a flat from my grandmother through inheritance (in life!!). I invested heavily in the renovation of the apartment to be able to offer the greatest comfort possible to my guests. I started managing the rent and the success was so amazing that it changed my life!\r
\r
My friends and family noticed how well my "business" was going and started to ask me to manage their apartment\u2019s rent too (at the time, the figure of  the co-host didn\u2019t exist).\r
\r
I accepted the challenge and the number of apartments was multiplying! The result was great and I realized that I felt very fulfilled with the experiences I was gaining as an entrepreneur and by meeting people from so many places in the world! So I decided to leave my job as a marketing manager to dedicate myself exclusively to you!\r
\r
I took a tour guide course to gain more knowledge about the city and opened the All in Rio, a Tourism Agency that offers cultural, natural and adventure tours, as well as apartments for seasonal rents.\r
\r
My goal is to offer you a safe and comfortable stay and to be able to provide all the information necessary so you can enjoy your experience in our wonderful city to the fullest!\r
\r
Thank you for your time!\r
\r
Fabio\r

The place is cozy and immaculate. Other than the bed being a bit stiff, I loved being in the apartment. The water was hot, the wi-fi worked perfectly. The only negative that I had about the room was the noise. \r
\r
The unit is situated on the 2nd floor of the building right outside a busy street. Every night around midnight, two bars would open up across the and start blaring music. The music would not stop until 8am the next morning. I ended up having to buy a white noise machine just to last through the night.\r
\r
The only other feedback I had was around Fabio, the host. All of the reviews mentioned how responsive and helpful he was. However that was not the case for me. The day I booked, I couldn't get him to respond to the booking. I even had to have AirBnB call him. And then I asked him about touring the city. Instead of offering, he pointed me to a few self serve options. When I asked again, he said he would plan a trip then never responded. When I responded to him, he said he was too busy and my trip was over. \r
\r
Fabio being my tour guide is not a huge requirement, but I had thought he would be more willing (or suggest someone), given the feedback people had for him o this site.\r
\r
All in all, great place if you don't mind the noise and don't need a helpful host. `},{at:"2014-09-25T04:00:00.000Z",by:{_id:"622f3402e36c59e6164fad76",fullname:"Armelle",imgUrl:"https://robohash.org/5051864?set=set1",id:"5051864"},txt:`Fabio a \xE9t\xE9 adorable.\r

What we loved: (1) Location (2) Quietness! (3) Comfortable beds\r

What we didn't: (1) Initially given wrong address. That made arrival stressful.

The apartment was perfect. Located in Midtown East near the UN, in an unbelievably quiet neighborhood. Train stops were accessible within a few short blocks of walking distance. Its close proximity to 5th Avenue, Central Park, & Times Square allowed us to have access to all the touristy NYC sites without any of the noise. I'd highly recommend the flat to anyone.\r

I lived in New York before and I travel to New York quite often, therefore, I am quite familiar with city. 1. Joris is a very nice person. He is always willing to assist you and to accommodate to your requests. He answers almost immediately all your messages. I am quite grateful with him as we could agree on an early check-in and a late check-out. In fact, my parents are in their 80s and I needed to make the trip a comfortable experience for them. 2. Ups (i) The apartment is extremely well located (51st and Second Avenue). It is in midtown and you can enjoy the city just walking. The subway is three blocks away from the apartment. (ii) Even though in midtown, the neighbourhood is tranquil, neat, charming and not noisy. (iii) For New York standards, the apartment is big. Please consider -if you have never been in New York- that places size tend to be quite small in Manhattan. Space is a luxury in the city. (iv) The apartment is on a first floor which is quite helpful as New York's buildings sometimes do not have elevator (you should always ask if there is one if you are renting an apartment). (v) The apartment has one living - dining room, a small kitchen, two bedrooms and two bathrooms. I will not recommend it for more than 4 people. One bedroom is located on the first floor and the second one is located in the basement. (vi) The apartment is cozy. It looks like in the pictures. (vii) The patio is lovely. It is very unusual to find an apartment with its own access to a patio in New York. (vii) The beds are quite comfortable. I travel a lot and stay in several 4-5 stars hotels. The beds were as comfortable as the ones I find in my trips. 3. Matters to be considered: (i) Being the apartment in an old building you can hear the noise of your neighbours, particularly at night, which may cause troubles for having a restful sleep. My parents, who stayed on the first floor, were awaken some nights for the noise coming from the second floor (around midnight, apparently they move furnitures). (ii) The room located in the basement is particularly noisy at nights. It is next to a corridor where the washing machines are located and which also provides access to the patio. As I slept in that room, I needed to wear ear-plugs for not to be awaken at nights. However, one night not even the ear-plugs helped. I heart people walking and talking in the corridor very late that night. I walked up scared as I thought there was actually somebody in my room! (iii) The door in the basement needs curtains. In fact, there is one door which provides access to the patio with a window which allows people in the patio to see..."},{at:"2016-10-16T04:00:00.000Z",by:{_id:"622f3407e36c59e6164fbfe8",fullname:"Claudia",imgUrl:"https://robohash.org/9239670?set=set1",id:"9239670"},txt:"El apartemento era estupendo, super bien ubicado, limpio y c\xF3modo.

This unit was nearly perfect for us, in consideration that we were there for the atmosphere, not a fancy hotel experience. The view of course is unbeatable. If this unit were any closer to the ocean, it would have fish in it. It's in a smaller complex, with nobody above you. \r
\r
The neighborhood is okay; appeared to be safe, and there are some eating/shopping options close by, but most restaurants and shops you may want to go to are a little further afield, but not more than a 3-5 minute drive (Kaanapali itself is about 10 minutes away, which is a good thing in my opinion). The road the complex is on is fairly busy, but not too noisy (most cars are going pretty slow here), see more below.\r
\r
The complex itself is pretty old but appeared to be very well-maintained. There's a small beach adjacent to the complex that's okay for recreational bathing but not a destination in itself. The overall vibe was very private and intimate; a very friendly atmosphere. The pool was a huge added bonus for us; the kids wanted to use it practically every day. Honokowai Park was on the other side of the complex; we didn't go here, but the recon I did on a walk gave me the impression that the park was okay but nothing to write home about.\r
\r
The overall noise level here was very minimal; no loud guests or screaming kids. There is some road noise in the front bedroom, and although I wasn't in that bedroom, it wouldn't have bugged me, and I'm a light sleeper. \r
\r
The baths were very nice and almost resort-y; overall, they were very clean although the grout could use a good cleaning, just saying. The kitchen was more than adequate for our needs, and had quite a bit of storage space. We also used the barbecues on premise a couple of times; they're impeccably maintained.\r
\r
The only thing that is a drawback to this place in my opinion is that the loft can get quite stuffy, even with the fans going full blast. We were there in August, and several nights up there were fine, some others were uncomfortable, and there was 2 nights where it was extremely hard to sleep up there.\r
\r
So overall, this place is perfect if you value a tranquil atmosphere with a killer view, in a nice unit in a pleasant complex, at a fair price. If you have enough guests to where you have to utilize the loft, the weather may be a roll of the dice as to how comfortable it is.`},{at:"2016-08-26T04:00:00.000Z",by:{_id:"622f3406e36c59e6164fba6e",fullname:"Purnima",imgUrl:"https://robohash.org/83546782?set=set1",id:"83546782"},txt:"Angelica's apartment is excellent and the view is out of the world.

Toilet - at the shower area, to do a sliding door instead of using curtain  as water will spill to the floor near the toilet bowl area.
No place to hang socks after washing. 
Sofa bed - material catch dust easily. To extend it to become a bed and making sure that it is fixed correctly, must be extra careful as  my son hurt his hand.

Host service is a close second. Jenkin is an accessible and attentive host, and that's something you may need in a complicated city like Hong Kong. This is an efficiently designed very small space which makes it seem larger than it is. The layout is (1) a bed-sized sleeping area with a curtain and sliding door for privacy; (2) a comfortably sized and appointed bathroom with a nicely tiled shower with plenty of hot water and strong water pressure; and (3) a living room with comfortable sofa, reliable wifi, and clothes hanging rack. There is a fridge and microwave and hotplate, with enough cookware for two people. You wash your dishes in the bathroom.  All three rooms are recently remodeled and tiled.  The bed is very comfortable. Both the bedroom and living room have air conditioners.\r
\r
The little apartment is on the 6th floor of an old and dingy (but clean) Kowloon apartment building one block from the stunning fountains of Kowloon Park and the subway, and a million places right there in your face.  It is a 10 minute exciting walk (as in every single time its exciting) to the picturesque  harbor ferry to Hong Kong Island (or you can take the subway there).  Like many Asian buildings, the elevators are very slow and often crowded with friendly people, but remarkably, each floor has an elevator on either end of the hallway. You walk out of Jenkin's apartment, look left and look right to see which elevator will arrive first, a fun little game for us. \r
\r
The very safe neighborhood is extremely trendy, filled with excited locals and tourists, and many places open until late. (My favorite bar and restaurant were open until 3am, both very funky). \r
\r
I might stay in one of Jenkin's larger units next time but, you know, I'm not sure since this little place just grows on you after two days.  He is a master host, his cleaning lady is so nice and right nearby, and he takes a lot of pride in making your stay high quality.  He even guided our taxi driver to the front door by cell phone, and he is always, always accessible.  It's remarkable. \r

There is one elevator at each end of the long hall on the 6th floor but on the ground level they are completely separated.  A few times I waited on the ground floor in a queue for 15-20 minutes and the elevator fills up before being able to get in, so plan your trips, don't expect to go in and out a lot, and avoid mid-day and evening hours when people are coming home.

I stayed for 3 months and loved every second of it, only regretting that I could not stay for another three. The landlords are fantastic and experienced Airbnb hosts, which makes the experienced that much better. Fatma is an outstanding cook, and one should not miss a chance to dine with her and Hasan! The house is great, very typical and nice - as a bonus, the bathrooms were all renovated and they look fantastic. The terrace made for many evenings relaxing away from the hustle and bustle of Istiklal St. In terms of location, the house is in a great spot: seconds away from Istiklal, minutes from Taksim and the cool Cihangir area, and a short train ride or longer walk to Sultanahmet, Topkapi and all the tourist sites. Would recommend without any hesitation, as I already did to two friends of mine who also stayed at Fatma and Hasan's house.

The room is lovely and fits the description. I also really enjoyed the beautiful terrasse from where you can watch the neighborhood. I thought the house was in an ideal location to explore the city. The street where the house is on is pretty calm. \r
This room is on the same floor with the terrasse and the kitchen, so you have ideal access to both of them. The kitchen is ideal if you just want to cook something small from time to time as there's only one cooking plate.\r
This room is perfect for people that wish to be in contact with the host and exchange with them from time to time as you walk by their living room and kitchen as well as share the bathroom with them. If you rather be a little more to your own and mind cigarette smoke, I recommend one of the other rooms.\r
Fatma and Hasan are both very very nice, always asked about my day and they were very patient when I tried to say something in turkish. I hope that my turkish will be better one day so that we can have longer and deeper conversations!  They made me feel very welcomed and I also really enjoyed meeting Fatma's daughter and grandson!They are very generous, sometimes invited me for tea or something to eat. I also got lucky to taste some of Fatma's amazing food! `},{at:"2015-10-01T04:00:00.000Z",by:{_id:"622f3402e36c59e6164fae07",fullname:"Franziska",imgUrl:"https://robohash.org/15407390?set=set1",id:"15407390"},txt:`It was fantastic to stay at the house of Fatma and Hasan!

Particularly if you are in Istanbul because of learning Turkish Fatma and Hasan\xB4s house will be the best choice as both are very communicative and patiant with beginners. Above all Fatma and Hasan are such nice people, I am really looking forward to stay in contact with them. \r
I highly recommend the room. But you should have no problem with shareing the bathroom with the hosts as well as shareing the kitchen and the terasse with a lot of other guests who stay in the house. But that\xB4s why the attic room is the best one for people who want interact with the hosts and get to know other guests.\r

The room itself is super cute, with its own kitchen and terrace access, which I tremendously enjoyed as it gave me the sense of having an entire apartment.

Its ideal location in North Kihei is close to restaurants, many beaches, and interesting activities. From your lanai, you will see an ancient Hawaiian fish pond where green sea turtles sometimes come to bask; there is a quiet, shaded park, the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary (the only sanctuary dedicated to to humpback whales), and an awesome Indian restaurant right on the ocean. Located near the beginning of the longest uninterrupted white sand beach in the whole state, you can run (or walk) from our unit all the way (six miles -in front of Kihei Canoe Club, Maui Canoe Club and a few condos to the protected area along the Kealia Pond National Wildlife Refuge and board walk) to Maalaea Harbor (with the excellent Maui Ocean Center, Maui Golf & Sports park for the kids, many restaurants, Pacific Whale Foundation - and a bus stop to deliver you back in front of Kihei Bay Surf. Our complex has a good swimming pool, hot jacuzzi, tennis courts, BBQ area, and clean laundry facilities. \r
\r
Our corner unit is bigger and has more light than most of the other units in our complex. The wrap-around lanai offers more space than the other units as well. It has a queen bed and a sofa couch for sleeping. The unit has been renovated and upgraded several times since my mom first lived there when she arrived on Maui from Chicago in 1985 to teach English at Maui College. She loved her job and Kihei -- and she met a nice, handsome counsellor working at the college. They got married - and had me. \r
\r
And I just got married in August to my beautiful bride, who has a 8-year-old son. We feel very blessed. And we hope to share our love of place with you. \r
\r
At KBS, you will be close to Kihei Canoe Club, where both my mom and I have done competitive outrigger canoe paddling. You can experience being out on the water if you go to the KCC Visitor Paddle on Tuesday or Thursday morning. Get there by 7:15 am to make sure you get a spot. During the winter, you may see whales while you are on the water. Allow a couple of hours for the experience. My mom is a volunteer for the HIHWNMS - the free museum and whale sanctuary across the street. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, you can hear a free lecture from 11am until noon about the Humpback Whales. The museum is open from 10am-3pm, Monday-Friday, and on the last Saturday of the month from 10am-1pm. The mission is to educate the public and protect humpback whales and other marine life and our environment. \r
\r
Another activity that is nearby is Hawaiian singing, ukulele, and hula on Thursday nights from 7-8:30 pm. at the Keolahou Church, 177 S. Kihei Rd. It is joyful - and a glimpse of Hawaiian culture. \r

There were also two sets of snorkel gear which was great since we left one of ours at home accidentally. The beach towels were great too since they take up room when you bring your own. We enjoyed spending time by the pool and right across the road is a great park with a perfect swimming spot for kids. On our last day we had a late flight out and asked if we could stay a bit later so we could shower after the beach and John was very accommodating.

It's spacious (twice as big as the neighbouring condos!), clean, fresh and airy! A wrap around balcony which is perfect for a glass of wine at sunset! Ideal for drying clothes also! Screen doors back and front meant a breeze could run through the apartment. 
Swimming pool was really clean as was the hot tub and well looked after by the on site manager, Mark. The pool wasn't that busy so we felt like it was our own private pool on several occasions! There was a barbeque area beside the pool which was great to use on those evenings we didn't feel like going out for dinner! A laundry room was also situated beside the tennis courts. 
The location on Kihei was great, we had a beach right across the road that we could see from our balcony. No matter where you're  staying in Maui a car would definitely be necessary. John recommended Kihei car rental which turned out to be a fraction of the cost of an airport rental! A shuttle bus runs to the airport also from there. 
Monsoon Indian(restaurant)for any Indian lovers is directly across the road and was recommended by Johns dad to try it out, it was so good we went there twice! 
Snorkelers- there are so many great snorkelling beaches within a ten minute drive(by car)! 
Molokini + Turtle town-definitely a must!! 
The Road to Hana- beautiful scenery and waterfalls I would advise camping along the route as there is so much to see in just one day!! The road is quite windy and narrow! 
Definitely go to Hookipa beach near Paia if you want to see turtles basking around 17.00hrs! 
We can't wait to visit Maui again next year and were hoping John will have a free space for us in his condo!!

The location of the place is spectacular, the view is amazing (nestled inbetween so many skyscrapers) and getting in and out of the place is really easy! We had a bit of trouble checking-in, since we didn't have the apartment number in the information provided to us. That was not Tara's fault though.. When you come here, just make sure you get all of the neccessary info in advance from airbnb. The aparment was clean and well-kept and communication with Tara was easy and quick. She let us check out pretty late (3pm), which we really really appreciated! The only thing we didn't love about the place was that there sometimes was a bit of an odor coming out of the bathroom.. I'm pretty sure that isn't Tara's fault either though, it must be a problem with old plumbing. But there is a window in the shower, so it's very easy to just air-out the bathroom with the door closed!
Over all we are very very happy with our stay at Tara's place and would definitely come again:)`},{at:"2017-11-19T05:00:00.000Z",by:{_id:"622f3407e36c59e6164fbe8d",fullname:"Soowon",imgUrl:"https://robohash.org/72782310?set=set1",id:"72782310"},txt:"good and valuable place with nice location"},{at:"2017-11-23T05:00:00.000Z",by:{_id:"622f3405e36c59e6164fb6ef",fullname:"James",imgUrl:"https://robohash.org/7771827?set=set1",id:"7771827"},txt:`Tara\u2019s place is absolutely fabulous.

It was the first time for me to stay in an air bnb. Although I was quite confident from their profile before my arrival, the quality of my stay was even beyond my high expectations. Aurora and Alberto confirmed they are the ideal hosts, and their house and garden were the ideal place to stay. I arrived with an empty stomach, and Aurora took me to one of the neighborhood restaurants and explained the menu in English (6 Euros for everything). After lunch, Alberto showed me all flowers and trees in the garden and later he had set up the hammock between the trees. I relaxed myself in the peaceful atmosphere with birds chirping among the fragrant orange and jasmine blossoms. During the stay, my friend, Emma and I received more than what we needed: beautifully decorated room and bathroom, delicious daily breakfast (sometimes in their lovely garden), good recommendations for restaurants and 1 day trips to nearby towns (they had prepared to give us all the information we need before we arrived). They learned my precise breakfast request in one day and prepared perfectly for the rest of my 11 day-stay. Also we enjoyed their yoga classes in the studio which is located in the basement with the window opening out to the garden. They sometimes offered me the fresh vegetable-and-fruit juice and yummy soup (They are vegetarians). On Sunday, when they have no classes, they offered us to drive around town. The highlight of the tour was the museum which also has a huge garden. Alberto knows all the flowers and plants, and has a lot of stories about almost everything. I shared their tastes and felt they were my friends for years. I totally recommend this place and will come back in the near future for a longer stay.

Location:
A place looks as expected, 5 min from Kapalua Beach.  We didn't have any issues with neighborhood  condos. Despite there are a lot of people in this Condo Complex (Napili Ridge), we didn't feel the place to be crowdy (as well as elsewhere in Hawaii). While the most interesting activities (IMHO) are in Lahaina, there is just 12-15 min drive. You can drive elsewhere on Maui within 3.5-4 hours (one way).

Facilities/Equipment:
It really looks recently renovated, all facilities and equipment are good. There is a fridge, microwave and regular oven, plates and silverware. We enjoyed having breakfast on Patio with a nice garden view. Parking lots are not the issue - you just need to fill the form and submit it to management office.

Cleanliness:
The place was clean as expected. Host provided to us beach and bathroom towels which was greatly appreciated

Overall
Great value-for-money deal for Hawaii travelers who don't want to spend tons of money for vacation. Note that rental car is required in most cases when travelling to Maui.`},{at:"2017-08-30T04:00:00.000Z",by:{_id:"622f3406e36c59e6164fbbbc",fullname:"Kristina",imgUrl:"https://robohash.org/16714921?set=set1",id:"16714921"},txt:"The place was very cute.

The apartment had plenty of amenities and a fully stocked kitchen so you could certainly cook if you wanted to. There was even a blender and toaster. One item that was missing was a bottle opener! There are wine glasses but we couldn't find an opener... 

Although the area feels residential, it's a quick drive to many beaches and you could walk to Napili Bay, if you wanted to. It's very quiet so if you're looking for an escape from all the resorts, it serves as a good home base. 

Overall, we were very happy with our stay and appreciated the new-ness of the amenities, even if small (e.g. sponge, dish soap, etc.).`},{at:"2018-05-23T04:00:00.000Z",by:{_id:"622f3402e36c59e6164fac1f",fullname:"Janaye",imgUrl:"https://robohash.org/175874358?set=set1",id:"175874358"},txt:"Beautiful, clean, &  organized.

The Bus stop is at the end of the street, which was a perk as well. 
The place itself is lovely, warm and inviting \u2013 with everything you need. 
It was lovely living with residents of Maui, as we got the chance to get to know them and find the best local places to swim, eat and sight see. 
We will be back!!
